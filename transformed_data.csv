17,Grand Theft Auto V,PS3,2013.0,Action,Take-Two Interactive,7.01,9.27,0.97,4.14,21.4,Grand Theft Auto V,"Apr 13, 2015",20000000 - 50000000,170527,17,0.0,1,"When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other. Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second. The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes. The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing. Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks. Special access content requires Rockstar Games Social Club account.

Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second. The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes. The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing. Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM.

Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second. The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes. The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing.

Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second. The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes. The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing. Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.

62,Call of Duty: Ghosts,X360,2013.0,Shooter,Activision,6.72,2.63,0.04,0.82,10.21,Call of Duty®: Ghosts,"Mar 25, 2014",1000000 - 2000000,129,17,59.99,51,"Outnumbered and outgunned, but not outmatched. Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/header.jpg?t=1654830036,http://www.callofduty.com,http://support.activision.com/,,True,False,False,68,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/call-of-duty-ghosts?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,17030,10793,,40,9170,,503,0,296,0,Infinity Ward,Activision,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Dog,FPS,Action,Multiplayer,Shooter,First-Person,Military,Singleplayer,War,Co-op,Online Co-Op,America,Linear,Fast-Paced,Hacking,Survival Horror,Futuristic,Tactical,Team-Based,Competitive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_40eccd8d9da36152496ed7cb625f1b3cde3848ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_4034e8573255a5cca333b42bb78aea9ec05118dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_007e6bb9311b3ebfc9441a6965699abc1f66971c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_f62dec40365369a31ecf04691fcabec9fed042bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_ada57e47a9fc25445a201ee189c3b44017224b42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_d0960fe4c60e578c033d8f5c23636e8808a04c0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030019/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359449,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029955/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359325,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029908/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359288,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029794/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359231,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029788/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359230,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029623/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029593/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359068,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029594/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029595/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029596/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028745/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028743/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028744/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970"

Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode.

The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance. Assassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players. Assassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin. EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin. RENAISSANCE ITALY Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder. A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose. DYNAMIC CROWD Discover a living, breathing world where every character is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with the crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide ample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences. BECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN Perfect your skills to become a master assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to disarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and assassinate enemies using both hidden blades.

Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second. The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes. The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way. Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing. Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.

Check out the remastered HD version of Resident Evil. In 1998 a special forces team is sent to investigate some bizarre murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. Upon arriving they are attacked by a pack of blood-thirsty dogs and are forced to take cover in a nearby mansion. But the scent of death hangs heavy in the air. Supplies are scarce as they struggle to stay alive. Graphics More detailed graphics that retain the horror. The environments come alive with detail thanks to resolution upgrades and non-static 3D models. Post-processing effects like Bloom filters, which were not easy to do at the time of the original release, have been added to make the HD graphics even more realistic. High-Resolution Environments - We've increased the resolution of the background environments by recreating them with a mix of high-res static images, plus animated 3D models. Widescreen Support Widescreen (16:9) is supported, so players can experience a greater sense of immersion. In widescreen mode, the screen will scroll. The parts of the screen that get cut off on the top and bottom will scroll into view automatically depending on the character's position. You can switch the display mode during gameplay in real time.

The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance. Assassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players. Assassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin. EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin. RENAISSANCE ITALY Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder. A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose. DYNAMIC CROWD Discover a living, breathing world where every character is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with the crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide ample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences. BECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN Perfect your skills to become a master assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to disarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and assassinate enemies using both hidden blades.

It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay. Key Features Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout. Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle. New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics. An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time. Let it Ride!

In The Witcher, you play as professional monster hunter Geralt of Rivia tasked with finding a child of prophecy in a vast open world rich with merchant cities, pirate islands, dangerous mountain passes, and forgotten caverns to explore. KEY FEATURES PLAY AS A HIGHLY TRAINED MONSTER SLAYER FOR HIRE Trained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength and reflexes, witchers are a counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live. Gruesomely destroy foes as a professional monster hunter armed with a range of upgradeable weapons, mutating potions and combat magic. Hunt down a wide range of exotic monsters — from savage beasts prowling the mountain passes, to cunning supernatural predators lurking in the shadows of densely populated towns. Invest your rewards to upgrade your weaponry and buy custom armour, or spend them away in horse races, card games, fist fighting, and other pleasures the night brings. EXPLORE A MORALLY INDIFFERENT FANTASY OPEN WORLD Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth and complexity. Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains and seas. Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services. Make choices that go beyond good &amp; evil, and face their far-reaching consequences. CHASE DOWN THE CHILD OF PROPHECY Take on the most important contract to track down the child of prophecy, a key to save or destroy this world. In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends. Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds and even a threat from beyond the veil – all hell-bent on controlling this world. Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving. FULLY REALIZED NEXT GENERATION Built exclusively for next generation hardware, the REDengine 3 renders the world of The Witcher visually nuanced and organic, a real true to life fantasy. Dynamic weather systems and day/night cycles affect how the citizens of the towns and the monsters of the wilds behave. Rich with storyline choices in both main and subplots, this grand open world is influenced by the player unlike ever before.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Czech', 'Hungarian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']",“ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE” 10/10 – GameSpot “AMAZING” 9.3/10 – IGN “ONE OF THE BEST RPGs EVER MADE” 9.8/10 – Game Trailers,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/header.jpg?t=1646996408,http://www.thewitcher.com,http://en.cdprojektred.com/support,http://en.cdprojektred.com/contact-support/,True,False,False,93,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,617738,25020,,78,591701,,3696,638,929,112,CD PROJEKT RED,CD PROJEKT RED,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV",RPG,"Open World,RPG,Story Rich,Atmospheric,Mature,Fantasy,Adventure,Singleplayer,Choices Matter,Nudity,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,Medieval,Action,Multiple Endings,Action RPG,Magic,Dark Fantasy,Dark,Sandbox","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_107600c1337accc09104f7a8aa7f275f23cad096.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_64eb760f9a2b67f6731a71cce3a8fb684b9af267.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_eda99e7f705a113d04ab2a7a36068f3e7b343d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_d5b80eb63c12a6484f26796f3e34410651bba068.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_b74d60ee215337d765e4d20c8ca6710ae2362cc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_dc55eeb409d6e187456a8e159018e8da098fa468.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_849ec8dcc6f8df1c0b2c509584c9fc9e51f88cfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_90a33d7764a2d23306091bfcb52265c3506b4fdb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_07812c174bb6b96c29895ddc27404143df7aba6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_ed23139c916fdb9f6dd23b2a6a01d0fbd2dd1a4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_dc33eb233555c13fce939ccaac667bc54e3c4a27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_908485cbb1401b1ebf42e3d21a860ddc53517b08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_608af6cfe0eab3f37265550b391732a3e88d1a4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_8ac1dc847388e59b1be1c5ea5ca592d5861756cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256658589/movie_max.mp4?t=1528288687,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2039385/movie_max.mp4?t=1447374875"

Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/header.jpg?t=1654830036,http://www.callofduty.com,http://support.activision.com/,,True,False,False,68,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/call-of-duty-ghosts?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,17030,10793,,40,9170,,503,0,296,0,Infinity Ward,Activision,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Dog,FPS,Action,Multiplayer,Shooter,First-Person,Military,Singleplayer,War,Co-op,Online Co-Op,America,Linear,Fast-Paced,Hacking,Survival Horror,Futuristic,Tactical,Team-Based,Competitive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_40eccd8d9da36152496ed7cb625f1b3cde3848ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_4034e8573255a5cca333b42bb78aea9ec05118dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_007e6bb9311b3ebfc9441a6965699abc1f66971c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_f62dec40365369a31ecf04691fcabec9fed042bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_ada57e47a9fc25445a201ee189c3b44017224b42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_d0960fe4c60e578c033d8f5c23636e8808a04c0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030019/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359449,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029955/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359325,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029908/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359288,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029794/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359231,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029788/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359230,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029623/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029593/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359068,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029594/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029595/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029596/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028745/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028743/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028744/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970"

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each 'movie' is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives. New technology dubbed 'the AI Director' is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie. Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them. See how long you and your friends can hold out against the infected horde in the new Survival Mode An advanced AI director dynamically creates intense and unique experiences every time the game is played 20 maps, 10 weapons and unlimited possibilities in four sprawling 'movies' Matchmaking, stats, rankings, and awards system drive collaborative play Designer's Commentary allows gamers to go 'behind the scenes' of the game Powered by Source and Steam THE SACRIFICE 'The Sacrifice” is the new add-on for Left 4 Dead. 'The Sacrifice' is the prequel to 'The Passing,' and takes place from the L4D Survivors' perspective as they make their way South. In addition to advancing the story, 'The Sacrifice' introduces a new style finale featuring 'Sacrificial Gameplay' where players get to decide who will give their life so the others may live. In The Sacrifice for Left 4 Dead owners receive 'The Sacrifice' campaign playable in Campaign, Versus, and Survival modes.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/header.jpg?t=1623087651,http://www.l4d.com/,http://steamcommunity.com/app/500,,True,True,False,89,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/left-4-dead?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,40244,1610,,73,34087,"Includes realistic violence, blood and gore involving zombie-like creatures.",1098,300,141,455,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Captions available,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Includes Source SDK,Commentary available,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together",Action,"Zombies,Co-op,Multiplayer,FPS,Action,Horror,Shooter,Online Co-Op,Survival,Team-Based,First-Person,Post-apocalyptic,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Adventure,Moddable,Tactical,Replay Value,Competitive,Female Protagonist","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006028.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006029.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006030.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006031.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006032.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006033.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006034.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006035.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006036.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006037.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006038.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/500/0000006039.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623087651","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5149/movie_max.mp4?t=1447351572,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5952/movie_max.mp4?t=1447353587,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5138/movie_max.mp4?t=1447351552,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5139/movie_max.mp4?t=1447351553,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5141/movie_max.mp4?t=1447351555,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5150/movie_max.mp4?t=1447351571"

It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay. Key Features Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout. Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle. New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics. An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time. Let it Ride! In a huge, open world with unlimited options you can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone.

Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet. Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that’s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other! World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.) 87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you’ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.

Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/header.jpg?t=1654830036,http://www.callofduty.com,http://support.activision.com/,,True,False,False,68,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/call-of-duty-ghosts?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,17030,10793,,40,9170,,503,0,296,0,Infinity Ward,Activision,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Dog,FPS,Action,Multiplayer,Shooter,First-Person,Military,Singleplayer,War,Co-op,Online Co-Op,America,Linear,Fast-Paced,Hacking,Survival Horror,Futuristic,Tactical,Team-Based,Competitive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_40eccd8d9da36152496ed7cb625f1b3cde3848ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_4034e8573255a5cca333b42bb78aea9ec05118dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_007e6bb9311b3ebfc9441a6965699abc1f66971c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_f62dec40365369a31ecf04691fcabec9fed042bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_ada57e47a9fc25445a201ee189c3b44017224b42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_d0960fe4c60e578c033d8f5c23636e8808a04c0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030019/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359449,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029955/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359325,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029908/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359288,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029794/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359231,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029788/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359230,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029623/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029593/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359068,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029594/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029595/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029596/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028745/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028743/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028744/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970"

Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars. Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge. True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus. Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online. Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race. Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences. Photo-Realistic Cars and Tracks - Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Russian']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/header.jpg?t=1622575105,http://shift.needforspeed.com/home.action,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,2037,615,,0,2409,,618,9,494,9,Slightly Mad Studios,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Multi-player,Partial Controller Support",Racing,"Racing,Automobile Sim,Simulation,Driving,Multiplayer,Controller,Open World,Arcade,Singleplayer,Action,First-Person,Realistic","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_4c36d047c87d6fb871392c82f355527a1886e500.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_b26369c817768059b2fe47dc3b36994a1c6e2afe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_365bb1a8d74958c86d03a9ace6422c26b85f4c71.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_f8dddcbce7e0bc45dc81eb503c7d0b3b600e0cec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_0b05cdeafd5ee7590204f97baed6460b6d20312a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_a49d7527b373c74cafb8f192d87db59133867758.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_31e5db2c5968a9aece22f7800ebe000c8945f446.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_0de76a67a65d07199b3a1c0a60b5e4f546743c79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_57a295c8c6c218b85560be3d221d92306730441a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_d329bcab41fbae0a18cbb11d409c8e704955f111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105",

For any questions relating to Batman: Arkham Origins, please contact WB Games customer service / . Batman™: Arkham Origins is the next installment in the blockbuster Batman: Arkham videogame franchise. Developed by WB Games Montréal, the game features an expanded Gotham City and introduces an original prequel storyline set several years before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City, the first two critically acclaimed games of the franchise. Taking place before the rise of Gotham City’s most dangerous criminals, the game showcases a young and unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight. Key Features: The Arkham Story Begins: Batman: Arkham Origins features a pivotal tale set on Christmas Eve where Batman is hunted by eight of the deadliest assassins from the DC Comics Universe. Players become an early-career Batman as he encounters for the first time many of the characters that shape his future. Enhanced Detective Mode: Think like Batman with an all-new Case File system that allows players to analyze seemingly impossible-to-solve crime reconstructions in real time. Combining Batman’s cowl sensors with the Batcomputer, players can digitally recreate crimes and study detailed simulation of the act as it happened. Gotham City will learn to fear Batman: Take back the sprawling streets of Gotham years before its transformation into Arkham City. Glide above or battle your way through new and ever more dangerous districts in the quest for justice. Prevent crimes in progress, take down gangs of violent new criminals and explore deadly new locations, from the impoverished streets to the penthouses of Gotham’s wealthy. Gotham’s Most Wanted: The city streets are filled with more than just Black Mask’s assassins. Locate and take down Gotham’s most violent and dangerous criminals to earn unique upgrades. Lethal New Enemies: Fight new foes such as the Armored Enforcer, the Martial Artist and more – each of which challenge players to approach Batman’s FreeFlow Combat scenarios in different ways. Classic FreeFlow combat is expanded with every new opponent – and with Batman’s abilities to engage them. New Gadgets: Utilize Batman’s signature gadgets or take advantage of powerful new additions such as the Remote Claw, the Concussion Detonator and more. Use the Remote Claw to create new routes by deploying strategic tightropes or directly attack enemies by stringing them up from vantage points. Ready the Concussion Detonator to stun and disorient groups of opponents in close combat. New and Familiar Characters: Experience a fresh take on iconic Batman characters including Black Mask, Penguin, Deathstroke, Bane, Deadshot, Anarky, Captain Gordon, The Joker, Copperhead, Firefly and others yet to be revealed.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209000/header.jpg?t=1634157113,http://www.batmanarkhamorigins.com/,http://support.wbgames.com,support@wbgames.com,True,False,False,74,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,34954,4803,,60,25470,,1030,5,517,5,"WB Games Montreal,Splash Damage",Warner Bros.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named Best PC Game Ever by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial muscles, human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Dutch', 'Danish', 'Finnish', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Swedish', 'Thai']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Thai']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/header.jpg?t=1591063154,http://www.half-life2.com,http://steamcommunity.com/app/220,,True,True,True,96,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/half-life-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,142368,3687,,33,110892,,606,185,311,315,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Includes Source SDK,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play Together",Action,"FPS,Action,Sci-fi,Classic,Singleplayer,Story Rich,Shooter,First-Person,Adventure,Dystopian,Atmospheric,Zombies,Silent Protagonist,Physics,Aliens,Great Soundtrack,Horror,Puzzle,Multiplayer,Moddable","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001864.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001865.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001866.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001867.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001869.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001871.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001872.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/904/movie_max.mp4?t=1569623096,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5724/movie_max.mp4?t=1569623106"

Guide your Sim’s path through life, developing a career, finding love, and pursuing dreams and desires. Spending time with friends and family is just as important as mastering painting or accumulating knowledge. Take things to the next level and record movies of your Sim’s adventures and share them with the ever-growing and thriving community. With a huge catalog of expansion packs and fun objects to discover, there is no end to the possibilities awaiting you. It all begins here; your adventure awaits!

Don't grind; play the way you want to play! Whether you're reviving defeated players, rescuing soldiers from a Risen onslaught, or gathering herbs, you'll earn experience points. Arm your character with an arsenal of new weapons as you play. Every profession wields them differently, and each type has its own playstyle, which you can refine and customize by unlocking and equipping hundreds of skills and traits. If you want to jump straight into structured PvP, go for it—every player competes at the same level, with access to the max-level gear and build options you need to make your mark. If you love fashion, express yourself with the perfect character design! When you equip new weapons and armor, you'll unlock their skins in your wardrobe. Make them truly yours with thousands of possible combinations and a massive selection of collectible dyes. Upgrade your free account with a Guild Wars 2 expansion and get access to log-in rewards, additional character and bag slots, expanded chat features, and more. Visit the Black Lion Trading Company in the game and use your Steam Wallet to upgrade. Expansions and Living World seasons feature unique rewards and new Masteries to expand your character's abilities. Unlock and upgrade your glider in Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns, befriend a stable of mounts with powerful movement skills in Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire, and learn to fish and pilot a skiff in Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons. Each expansion grants access to nine elite specializations that unlock new weapon choices, skills, and abilities for your profession. You'll also be able to select the revenant profession at character creation and channel legendary heroes and villains from Tyria's history. Living World seasons continue the Guild Wars 2 story between expansions and must be purchased separately through your Story Journal or in Gem Store bundles. Play Living World episodes to unlock new explorable zones, rewards, and Masteries. *Living World episodes become playable at level 80. Players may need to relaunch the game for the upgrade to take effect. **Please note that existing Guild Wars 2 player accounts cannot be accessed via Steam","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']",“One of the most exhaustively detailed and rewarding MMOs in existence.” 9/10 – IGN “The best online role-playing game in years.” 90/100 – Gamespot “The Best MMO I've played in Years.” Game Informer,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/header.jpg?t=1661291821,https://www.guildwars2.com/en/,https://help.guildwars2.com/,support@arena.net,True,False,False,90,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/guild-wars-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1323,223,,0,0,,36,36,62,62,ArenaNet®,NCSOFT,"Multi-player,MMO,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,In-App Purchases","Adventure,Free to Play,Massively Multiplayer,RPG","MMORPG,Adventure,RPG,Fantasy,3D,Third Person,PvP,Character Customization,Strategy,Atmospheric,Massively Multiplayer,Class-Based,Combat,Crafting,Multiplayer,Free to Play,Online Co-Op,Deckbuilding,Story Rich,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_7f65b15609337bc9572dca6e8d8581b68eda5cc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_4b7455bd82c363c7c39136159b35966fe65b3b20.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_b3618fdfd2b0ba2769d99f07b65501647a329265.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_b2cf5ab5ad9c3a301dc618c350187b4582f28d42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_16d02d96e95fa4d5de34934d21d6860e30b6522f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_487289be9f799b16e5793dd6df746e5e05e409a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_b461571f662bd00ce4ba9756c7f179b2001c407f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_9bb3630efc43a9a6ebf9fcc1604aff3570397e8a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_a4e94a02fcf6c667feda35a2cabcf3a6779ea1c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_7de2824dd0500cfad4ca33b810f09f2b7f1c08f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_7e6c8a43cabb538b889122af3de2ca0359573302.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_54901d1e2b63cdee8ab0aec4b19e32abdc44c0a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_21bbba912a7d7f3f72c54c1fa8345a0a265b59d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_4690aba2777ae10bdf25c473f86c3feec6477adc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_e80ffe3b2e8a6988a99936124632150a5058fdc3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_10f5e534d4ab8a1d8964bcdd1ff80b13b0f9c8db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1284210/ss_288b2b5672d950f71f72171c014163ea7a350c7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1661291821","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256902263/movie_max.mp4?t=1661279391,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256902320/movie_max.mp4?t=1661291601,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256887083/movie_max.mp4?t=1660651242"

In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, the world was introduced to Darth Vader’s now fugitive apprentice, Starkiller—the unlikely hero who would ignite the flames of rebellion in a galaxy so desperately in need of a champion. In the sequel, Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one true love, Juno Eclipse. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Starkiller is once again the pawn of Darth Vader—but instead of training his protégé as a ruthless assassin, the dark lord is attempting to clone his former apprentice in an attempt to create the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on – Starkiller is in pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller. With all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies across exciting worlds from the Star Wars films - all in his desperate search for answers to his past. Key features: Continue the galaxy-altering journey of Starkiller, Darth Vader's fugitive apprentice, that shapes the key events between Star Wars: Episode III and Episode IV. Unleash the Force with more power and precision through improved controls and new powers, such as the deceptive Mind Trick, which turns enemies against their allies. Discover the true power of Starkiller with Force Fury, where his attacks and Force powers are exponentially increased. Improved targeting system enhances precision use of Force powers and greater interaction with puzzles and the environment. Take combat to the next level with the ability to wield dual lightsabers and punish enemies with all-new combo attacks. Experience the most life-like interactions with Pixelux Entertainment's Digital Molecular Matter (DMM) coupled with euphoria from Natural Motion Ltd and the powerful Havok Physics system.

Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet. Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that’s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other! World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.) 87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you’ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2. Note: The Mac and Linux versions of Borderlands 2 are available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish only.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Korean', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese']","“Prepare to level.

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game. The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively. Product Features Extensive single player: Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story. Complete two-person co-op: Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay. Advanced physics: Allows for the creation of a whole new range of interesting challenges, producing a much larger but not harder game. Original music. Massive sequel: The original Portal was named 2007's Game of the Year by over 30 publications worldwide. Editing Tools: Portal 2 editing tools will be included.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Hungarian', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Turkish']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/header.jpg?t=1610490805,http://www.thinkwithportals.com/,http://steamcommunity.com/app/620,,True,True,True,95,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/portal-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,298300,3638,,51,243925,,874,118,514,138,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Steam Workshop,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Stats,Includes level editor,Commentary available,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure","Platformer,Puzzle,Dark Humor,First-Person,Puzzle-Platformer,Story Rich,Funny,Female Protagonist,3D Platformer,Action-Adventure,Action,FPS,Co-op,Physics,Level Editor,Sci-fi,Science,Comedy,Atmospheric,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_f3f6787d74739d3b2ec8a484b5c994b3d31ef325.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_6a4f5afdaa98402de9cf0b59fed27bab3256a6f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_0cdd90fafc160b52d08b303d205f9fd4e83cf164.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_ec35a739b4b33270eb170d9e561c5b016cba50a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_3d13161104a04603a0524536770c5f74626db4c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_8a772608d29ffd56ac013d2ac7c4388b96e87a21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_358127df30a766a1516ad139083c2bcec3fe0975.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_410c7955c3cc8ca4a5e3c81daa214f534c9aabc8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_0e16bceacb6616a5ca4bc4ba4d28c7a0d06b671c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_d8f172249d6e89999c3692bf2c380921f197fd82.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_fe9782ea3b43ef7af37b18e0a5c5f7bdc9c21f12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620/ss_3858536cbc0a07dfbe36e8f87b3f08bf3be45e54.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610490805","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/81613/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903069,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80822/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903079,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80762/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903411,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80752/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903306,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80747/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903249,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80739/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903201,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80633/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903191,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5795/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903182,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5789/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903148,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5791/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903158,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5788/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903138,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5790/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903127,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5787/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903117,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5786/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903108,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5739/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903100,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5926/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/80788/movie_max.mp4?t=1452903420"

He escapes to the local shopping mall thinking it will be a bastion of safety, but it turns out to be anything but. It's a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but with full reign over an entire shopping center, Frank can utilize anything to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic. This action horror game brings new meaning to the phrase 'retail hell.' Dead Rising uses a dynamic real-time system in which time continues to pass whether Frank is actively engaged or remains stationary. For example, though they move slowly during the day, zombies become stronger and faster when the sun sets and make it even more difficult to survive at night. The unprecedented swarms come in never-ending waves and consist of a diverse population. These former humans retain some memory of their previous lives and it is reflected in their behavior and appearance. The variety of different stores in the mall offers an endless supply of resources including vehicles, makeshift weapons and more. Other survivors are encountered along the way and helping them can provide valuable clues as to what has happened. Key features: Huge Environments – Expansive indoor and outdoor areas of the mall provide a variety of different locations to explore! Swarm Technology – Allows an unprecedented amount of enemies on screen at once resulting in nonstop, pulse-pounding action. Intense Gore and Vibrant Realism. Anything in the mall is at Frank's disposal Move environmental objects like table umbrellas or mall benches. Snatch items from different stores to use as weapons, including golf clubs, lawnmowers, fry pans and more! Chow down on various 'mall food' to recover health. Real Time System – Key story elements happen at certain times whether Frank is on the spot or not. Don't miss any important events or opportunities! Use Frank's Photojournalistic Skills – Capture the insanity on film; the better the shot, the better the reward will be! NPCs – Help players navigate through the zombie-infested mall. Solve the Mystery – Why has the entire town turned into the undead?

A massive deep-space mining ship goes dark after unearthing a strange artifact on a distant planet. Engineer Isaac Clarke embarks on the repair mission, only to uncover a nightmarish blood bath  the ship's crew horribly slaughtered and infected by alien scourge. Now Isaac is cut off, trapped, and engaged in a desperate fight for survival. Strategically dismember the Necromorph enemies limb by bloody limb. Zero gravity combat means terror can strike from anywhere. Uncover the horrific truth of this shocking thriller. Game Features: Messy monster slaying The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time. Improvised weapons There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed. Real-time attacks. Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack. This nightmare has just begun and it’s up to get to the bottom of what happened here.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/header.jpg?t=1627659306,http://deadspace.ea.com/agegate.aspx?returnURL=/Default.aspx,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,86,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dead-space?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,20216,1946,,0,16949,,601,398,136,398,EA Redwood Shores,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure","Horror,Sci-fi,Action,Space,Third Person,Survival Horror,Atmospheric,Singleplayer,Third-Person Shooter,Gore,Shooter,Aliens,Dark,Futuristic,Story Rich,Silent Protagonist,Adventure,Survival,Zombies,Immersive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006482.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006483.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006484.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006485.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006486.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006487.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006488.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006489.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006490.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006491.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006492.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006493.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006494.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006496.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006497.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006498.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006499.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006500.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5163/movie_max.mp4?t=1585425675

In only a few days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos. The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, these Agents are trained to operate independently in order to save society. When Society Falls, We Rise. Features In this action shooter RPG, you will get a unique gameplay experience, mixing tactical combat and online features. Stride across New York’s streets alone or with up to 3 friends and define the fate of your Agent. As you explore the map, encounter dynamic events, loot &amp; craft new weapons &amp; gear, and customize your Agent to take back the city from vicious enemy factions. As you finish the campaign you will unlock new difficulty levels and transition to a whole new experience: the endgame.

Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars. Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge. True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus. Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online. Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race. Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences. Photo-Realistic Cars and Tracks - Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Russian']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/header.jpg?t=1622575105,http://shift.needforspeed.com/home.action,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,2037,615,,0,2409,,618,9,494,9,Slightly Mad Studios,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Multi-player,Partial Controller Support",Racing,"Racing,Automobile Sim,Simulation,Driving,Multiplayer,Controller,Open World,Arcade,Singleplayer,Action,First-Person,Realistic","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_4c36d047c87d6fb871392c82f355527a1886e500.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_b26369c817768059b2fe47dc3b36994a1c6e2afe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_365bb1a8d74958c86d03a9ace6422c26b85f4c71.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_f8dddcbce7e0bc45dc81eb503c7d0b3b600e0cec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_0b05cdeafd5ee7590204f97baed6460b6d20312a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_a49d7527b373c74cafb8f192d87db59133867758.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_31e5db2c5968a9aece22f7800ebe000c8945f446.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_0de76a67a65d07199b3a1c0a60b5e4f546743c79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_57a295c8c6c218b85560be3d221d92306730441a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_d329bcab41fbae0a18cbb11d409c8e704955f111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105",

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment.

It is extremely fun to play and the fascination of exploring is tremendous. Acclaim didn't make just a better sequel they made one of the best games of the year. For Turok and action fans you're in for a treat. Expansion pack isn't required to see awesome graphics but it raises resolution to give it a slick more detailed look, which is appreciated.” 100 – GameGenie “It's bigger and better in every way, including one of the best multiplayer modes ever made in Frag Tag. The addition of extra mission elements makes it as deep as GoldenEye. First-person action gamers will not be able to live without it.” 92 – Nintendo Power Magazine “So, what are you waiting for? Run right out and buy this game! Remember to buy the Expansion Pak--it’s worth it just for this game, and hopefully there will be future N64 games that will take advantage of it.

[Introducing the DOA Series] The DEAD OR ALIVE franchise is a AAA fighting game series produced by Koei Tecmo Games' Team NINJA. Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original DEAD OR ALIVE arcade game in 1996, and have since appeared on a multitude of consoles and arcade machines around the world. In DEAD OR ALIVE 6, the world of DOA is brought back more vibrant than ever, featuring both enhanced visuals and an updated combat systems, aimed to provide the highest possible level of new fighting entertainment. [Story] The story will follow the events of DEAD OR ALIVE 5, focusing on 2 separate main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the events that occur during the 6th DEAD OR ALIVE Tournament. New side story episodes will also be added for returning characters. [The New Visuals] With the help of a new graphics engine, DOA6 aims to bring visual entertainment of fighting games to an entirely new level. The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects. [The Triangle System] Following the tradition, fights in DEAD OR ALIVE 6 are based on a triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage. [New Combat Mechanics - Break System] In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button. [Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors. [New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Korean']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/header.jpg?t=1646807301,http://teamninja-studio.com/doa6/,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/support/,,True,False,False,73,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dead-or-alive-6?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,5403,1986,,36,3320,"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, Partial Nudity, Sexual Content",864,1904,101,1904,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,In-App Purchases,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together",Action,"Fighting,Sexual Content,Action,Nudity,Female Protagonist,Mature,Violent,Multiplayer,Competitive,Anime,3D Fighter,Ninja,Singleplayer,Free to Play,Gore,Great Soundtrack,Arcade,Local Multiplayer,Story Rich,Beat 'em up","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_2461d3a6c2dd2c0fd96dd07ad51af9b2e47f7b6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_0d2bf36eb3ac38da32c2bed7a5206c92beacba3d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_673f3e0df032fbf334feaf272bd9e62359996731.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_1d8581f39413c1f654a8f602cf5951b332f682f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_cfe118cb84ef505db71bb7b772ada6e2446fd02c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_66a519981ec336cbb3f3f1b8bdf4daddcd7426e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_b9a775f96c4bb51ffa56ff83a3cf1e471e634b18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_c67454ba84771bfdc38b5ad6edffc25be2396ff8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256728343/movie_max.mp4?t=1536577350,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256719170/movie_max.mp4?t=1528764286"

The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game. The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively. Product Features Extensive single player: Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story. Complete two-person co-op: Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay.

With Dishonored’s flexible combat system, creatively eliminate your targets as you combine the supernatural abilities, weapons and unusual gadgets at your disposal. Pursue your enemies under the cover of darkness or ruthlessly attack them head on with weapons drawn. The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make. Story: Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk- inspired technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows. You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever. Key features: Improvise and Innovate Approach each assassination with your own style of play. Use shadow and sound to your advantage to make your way silently through levels unseen by foes, or attack enemies head-on as they respond to your aggression. The flexible combat system allows you to creatively combine your abilities, supernatural powers and gadgets as you make your way through the levels and dispatch your targets. Improvise and innovate to define your play style. Action with Meaning The world of Dishonored reacts to how you play. Move like a ghost and resist corruption, or show no mercy and leave a path of destruction in your wake. Decide your approach for each mission, and the outcomes will change as a result. Supernatural Abilities Teleport for stealth approaches, possess any living creature, or stop time itself to orchestrate unearthly executions! Combining your suite of supernatural abilities and weapons opens up even more ways to overcome obstacles and eliminate targets. The game’s upgrade system allows for the mastery of deadly new abilities and devious gadgets. A City Unlike Any Other Enter an original world envisioned by Half-Life 2 art director Viktor Antonov. Arkane and Bethesda bring you a steampunk city where industry and the supernatural collide, creating an atmosphere thick with intrigue. The world is yours to discover.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","“A big, shiny example of so much we keep asking for in games, but rarely get” Editor's Choice - PC Gamer “Nothing short of a masterpiece” - Kotaku “A joy to play” “Engrossing from start to finish” 9.2/10 – IGN “It will blow you away” 5 out of 5 stars - The Escapist “Bold, original and brilliant” 9/10 – Destructoid",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/header.jpg?t=1598321484,http://www.dishonored.com,http://support.bethsoft.com/,,True,False,False,91,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dishonored?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,66292,1696,,80,51274,,757,18,417,23,Arkane Studios,Bethesda Softworks,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure","Stealth,First-Person,Action,Assassin,Steampunk,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Story Rich,Multiple Endings,Adventure,Dark,Magic,Dystopian,FPS,RPG,Replay Value,Fantasy,Immersive Sim,Open World,Shooter","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/ss_409bb8591d4c8278815510d9be737b57dfc57e06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598321484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/ss_32d76a6ff4b216410b90ff2cdb7107a28a1baed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598321484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/ss_fd7613fa1b8f19674cc0b4cd53db39c9618641fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598321484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/ss_8d26f4f83fb598eed36bdb0c6ecb41962a64ccf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598321484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/ss_e6f960fda9132baa23aca305359064dbc1b6f507.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598321484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/205100/ss_30e0328295a5d208283e69eb382fac2fa94809a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598321484",

With Dishonored’s flexible combat system, creatively eliminate your targets as you combine the supernatural abilities, weapons and unusual gadgets at your disposal. Pursue your enemies under the cover of darkness or ruthlessly attack them head on with weapons drawn. The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make. Story: Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk- inspired technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows. You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever. Key features: Improvise and Innovate Approach each assassination with your own style of play.

Improvise and innovate to define your play style. Action with Meaning The world of Dishonored reacts to how you play.

In Football Manager 2021 , dynamic, true-to-life management experiences and next-level detail renews that focus on you, the manager, equipping you with all the tools you need to achieve elite status. With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It’s over to you, boss. Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club’s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs… or face the consequences. Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention. This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.","['English', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'French', 'German', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Greek', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/header.jpg?t=1649698124,http://www.footballmanager.com/,https://support.sega.co.uk/,,True,True,False,0,,0,21654,1550,,98,13945,,16905,228,15789,250,Sports Interactive,SEGA,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Sports","Sports,Simulation,Management,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Soccer,Football,Strategy,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_fd42ad95cb1a3e7d9e48ef393362147210020ba7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_435711f30c32974d611c7015aaa04b5888ae1a83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_e21cf048fc8760c634f4bca91870ef2590485ace.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_0e08de5f60e5a2465c896015368b66ac69056d30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_631773adf9861490d7bf00164775d9ce62d2e4bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6bd99934c734b3021b1d4ce837229a05151c5a72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_acf44b07f87de85d71b387d7382befa23cf9b746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6c4363ceb1ef2db319355784318bb75a3fe5cdd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811823/movie_max.mp4?t=1606827380

Guide your Sim’s path through life, developing a career, finding love, and pursuing dreams and desires. Spending time with friends and family is just as important as mastering painting or accumulating knowledge. Take things to the next level and record movies of your Sim’s adventures and share them with the ever-growing and thriving community. With a huge catalog of expansion packs and fun objects to discover, there is no end to the possibilities awaiting you. It all begins here; your adventure awaits! Key Features Customize Your Sim: Mix and match a vast range of facial features and body types to get the look you want. Infuse your Sim with personality traits and help realize their dreams. Stage Your Own Extreme Makeover: Decorate your Sim’s home however you want, neat or messy. Use odd angles, create tall stacks of items, and apply your favorite self-made pattern to the walls and floors. Range From the Home: Get out of the house and explore the lively and entertaining neighborhood for the first time.

A massive deep-space mining ship goes dark after unearthing a strange artifact on a distant planet. Engineer Isaac Clarke embarks on the repair mission, only to uncover a nightmarish blood bath  the ship's crew horribly slaughtered and infected by alien scourge. Now Isaac is cut off, trapped, and engaged in a desperate fight for survival. Strategically dismember the Necromorph enemies limb by bloody limb. Zero gravity combat means terror can strike from anywhere. Uncover the horrific truth of this shocking thriller. Game Features: Messy monster slaying The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time. Improvised weapons There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed. Real-time attacks. Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard.

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

Amidst the chaos and violence of the French and Indian War, Shay Patrick Cormac, a fearless young member of the Brotherhood of Assassin’s, undergoes a dark transformation that will forever shape the future of the American colonies. After a dangerous mission gone tragically wrong, Shay turns his back on the Assassins who, in response, attempt to end his life. Cast aside by those he once called brothers, Shay sets out on a mission to wipe out all who turned against him and ultimately become the most feared Assassin hunter in history. Introducing Assassin’s Creed® Rogue, the darkest chapter in the Assassin’s Creed franchise yet. As Shay, you will experience the slow transformation from Assassin to Assassin Hunter.

Key Features Become the Ultimate Assassin Hunter - For the first time ever, experience the Assassin’s Creed universe from the perspective of a Templar. Play as Shay, who, in addition to the deadly skills of a Master Assassin, also possesses never before seen skills and weapons: o Equip Shay’s deadly air rifle for both short and long range combat. Distract, eliminate, or confuse your enemies by using a variety of ammunition, including specialized bullets and grenades o Protect yourself from hidden Assassins with your enhanced eagle vision. Constantly assess your surroundings and detect Assassins hiding in the shadows, on rooftops, and in the crowds Slowly Descend into Darkness - Witness Shay’s transformation from an adventurous Assassin to a grim and committed Templar willing to hunt down his former brothers. Experience first-hand the events that will lead Shay down a dark path and set him on a course that will forever change the fate of the Assassin Brotherhood. New and Improved Naval Gameplay - Cast off in your ship, The Morrigan, and fight your way through the icy seas of the North Atlantic and the narrow waters of America’s river valleys. Assassin’s Creed® Rogue builds on the award winning naval experience from Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ with all new gameplay including: o New enemy tactics: Defend yourself from Assassins as they attempt to board your ship and overthrow your crew. Fight them off quickly to avoid losing too many crew members. o New weapons: Including burning oil, which leaves a trail of fire behind to burn enemy ships, and the puckle gun, capable of delivering continuous machine-gun-like fire. o An arctic world full of possibilities: Ram through ice sheets to discover hidden locations and use icebergs as cover during naval battles. Vast Diverse Open World to Explore - Shay’s story will allow you to explore three unique environments: o The North Atlantic Ocean Experience the cold winds and towering icebergs of the arctic in this expansive naval playground o The River Valley A large hybrid setting of the American Frontier mixing seamless river navigation and ground exploration o New York City One of the most well-known cities in the world, fully recreated as it existed in the 18th century.

This HD remaster of the legendary RPG masterpiece introduces optimized graphics, a new dungeon to explore, new scenarios and a new game+ function. Select one of the 8 unique protagonists and embark on an epic adventure defined by your own choices! Once every 300 years, the Rise of Morastrum—an event where the dark star blocks out the sun—threatens the very existence of our world. All born in that year are doomed to perish before its end. Whether man or beast, none have a chance at survival. However, there came a time when a sole child did survive. He was entranced by the power of death, using it to conquer the world. He came to be known as the Archfiend. Yet one day, he simply vanished. Another 300 years passed, and again a child defied fate. She did not give in to the same powers that controlled the Archfiend, and came to be known as the Matriarch.

In Football Manager 2021 , dynamic, true-to-life management experiences and next-level detail renews that focus on you, the manager, equipping you with all the tools you need to achieve elite status. With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It’s over to you, boss. Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club’s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs… or face the consequences. Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention. This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.","['English', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'French', 'German', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Greek', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/header.jpg?t=1649698124,http://www.footballmanager.com/,https://support.sega.co.uk/,,True,True,False,0,,0,21654,1550,,98,13945,,16905,228,15789,250,Sports Interactive,SEGA,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Sports","Sports,Simulation,Management,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Soccer,Football,Strategy,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_fd42ad95cb1a3e7d9e48ef393362147210020ba7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_435711f30c32974d611c7015aaa04b5888ae1a83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_e21cf048fc8760c634f4bca91870ef2590485ace.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_0e08de5f60e5a2465c896015368b66ac69056d30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_631773adf9861490d7bf00164775d9ce62d2e4bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6bd99934c734b3021b1d4ce837229a05151c5a72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_acf44b07f87de85d71b387d7382befa23cf9b746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6c4363ceb1ef2db319355784318bb75a3fe5cdd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811823/movie_max.mp4?t=1606827380

EXPLORE A MORALLY INDIFFERENT FANTASY OPEN WORLD Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth and complexity. Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains and seas. Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services. Make choices that go beyond good &amp; evil, and face their far-reaching consequences. CHASE DOWN THE CHILD OF PROPHECY Take on the most important contract to track down the child of prophecy, a key to save or destroy this world. In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends. Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds and even a threat from beyond the veil – all hell-bent on controlling this world. Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving. FULLY REALIZED NEXT GENERATION Built exclusively for next generation hardware, the REDengine 3 renders the world of The Witcher visually nuanced and organic, a real true to life fantasy. Dynamic weather systems and day/night cycles affect how the citizens of the towns and the monsters of the wilds behave. Rich with storyline choices in both main and subplots, this grand open world is influenced by the player unlike ever before.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Czech', 'Hungarian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']",“ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE” 10/10 – GameSpot “AMAZING” 9.3/10 – IGN “ONE OF THE BEST RPGs EVER MADE” 9.8/10 – Game Trailers,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/header.jpg?t=1646996408,http://www.thewitcher.com,http://en.cdprojektred.com/support,http://en.cdprojektred.com/contact-support/,True,False,False,93,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,617738,25020,,78,591701,,3696,638,929,112,CD PROJEKT RED,CD PROJEKT RED,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV",RPG,"Open World,RPG,Story Rich,Atmospheric,Mature,Fantasy,Adventure,Singleplayer,Choices Matter,Nudity,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,Medieval,Action,Multiple Endings,Action RPG,Magic,Dark Fantasy,Dark,Sandbox","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_107600c1337accc09104f7a8aa7f275f23cad096.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_64eb760f9a2b67f6731a71cce3a8fb684b9af267.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_eda99e7f705a113d04ab2a7a36068f3e7b343d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_d5b80eb63c12a6484f26796f3e34410651bba068.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_b74d60ee215337d765e4d20c8ca6710ae2362cc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_dc55eeb409d6e187456a8e159018e8da098fa468.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_849ec8dcc6f8df1c0b2c509584c9fc9e51f88cfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_90a33d7764a2d23306091bfcb52265c3506b4fdb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_07812c174bb6b96c29895ddc27404143df7aba6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_ed23139c916fdb9f6dd23b2a6a01d0fbd2dd1a4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_dc33eb233555c13fce939ccaac667bc54e3c4a27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_908485cbb1401b1ebf42e3d21a860ddc53517b08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_608af6cfe0eab3f37265550b391732a3e88d1a4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_8ac1dc847388e59b1be1c5ea5ca592d5861756cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256658589/movie_max.mp4?t=1528288687,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2039385/movie_max.mp4?t=1447374875"

In Football Manager 2021 , dynamic, true-to-life management experiences and next-level detail renews that focus on you, the manager, equipping you with all the tools you need to achieve elite status. With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It’s over to you, boss. Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club’s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs… or face the consequences. Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention. This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.","['English', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'French', 'German', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Greek', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/header.jpg?t=1649698124,http://www.footballmanager.com/,https://support.sega.co.uk/,,True,True,False,0,,0,21654,1550,,98,13945,,16905,228,15789,250,Sports Interactive,SEGA,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Sports","Sports,Simulation,Management,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Soccer,Football,Strategy,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_fd42ad95cb1a3e7d9e48ef393362147210020ba7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_435711f30c32974d611c7015aaa04b5888ae1a83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_e21cf048fc8760c634f4bca91870ef2590485ace.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_0e08de5f60e5a2465c896015368b66ac69056d30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_631773adf9861490d7bf00164775d9ce62d2e4bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6bd99934c734b3021b1d4ce837229a05151c5a72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_acf44b07f87de85d71b387d7382befa23cf9b746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6c4363ceb1ef2db319355784318bb75a3fe5cdd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811823/movie_max.mp4?t=1606827380

It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay. Key Features Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout. Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle. New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics. An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals.

A highly trained special ops unit is sent in to help the rebels accomplish objectives that only a sniper can handle. In addition to intense sniper missions, players will also take part in a variety of assault scenarios where their prowess with weapons will be a huge help to the undermanned rebels. Sniper: Ghost Warrior seeks to challenge players in new ways so that the game is both demanding and entertaining. Developed by City Interactive’s dedicated next-gen games studio, Sniper: Ghost Warrior delivers an impressive visual and technological gaming experience and features a realistic ballistics system that measures bullet trajectory, bullet drop and environmental effects such as wind, fog &amp; rain. Encompassing a wide array of single and multiplayer levels, players will encounter a variety of challenging terrain. Players take on the role of a Ghost Warrior, an elite sniper in a highly trained special ops unit, whose unique skills in the art of stalking, target detection, surveillance and shooting accuracy will determine mission success. Covert missions force players to operate undetected as they attempt to eliminate hostile enemies one head shot at a time. Key Features: The most realistic sniping experience in a video game ever, right down to managing your breathing for increased accuracy of sniper shots. Enjoy a fully realistic ballistic system that accounts for bullet trajectory, including bullet drop and environmental effects such as wind, fog &amp; rain. Pull off the perfect headshot and watch your bullet strike the enemy with pin-point accuracy in Bullet Cam mode. 4 types of sniping rifles: AS50, MSG90, SR25 &amp; SVD Dragunov A variety of mission types ranging from sniper vs. sniper elimination, real-time tactical assault and fixed machine gun combat.

Because many of the missions take place in the Amazon jungle, there will often be plenty of thick vegetation to hide in.” ShackNews.com “I can see appeal to both ways of playing Sniper: one for its increased sense of satisfaction for hitting the shot -- complete with bullet chase cam to the perfect strike; the other for its simple pleasure of hitting a steady stream of headshots.” Destructoid.com “The great thing about Sniper: Ghost Warrior is that the “vision cone” of the game is insanely huge, so even though you might be hundreds of feet away from an enemy, they are more than capable of seeing you through a crack in a fence, or from across a canyon. It's a weird little element of the game that I found to be very impressive, something that was oddly

2001,Brink,X360,2011.0,Shooter,Bethesda Softworks,0.59,0.35,0.01,0.09,1.04,BRINK,"May 9, 2011",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,3,"Brink is an immersive first-person shooter that blends single-player, co-op, and multiplayer gameplay into one seamless experience, allowing you to develop your character whether playing alone, with your friends, or against others online. You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more. Brink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose? KEY FEATURES: Not Just Another Hero – Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character – allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique. As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you’ll have even more opportunities for customization. Two Sides to Every Story – Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players. Blurring the Lines – Take your unique character online at any time you choose! Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively. Play SMART – Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button. When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen.

The horrifying remains of humanity, ravaged by the terrifying disease, are shuffling through the streets, waiting at every turn to prey on your living flesh. The nail-biting survival experience of ZombiU™ has been upgraded for download on next-gen consoles and PC.

Features PURE SURVIVAL HORROR Resources are scarce, your enemies are numerous, and you never know when you’ll find more weapons, ammunition, first aid, or food. How you allocate your resources determines if you live or die. WITH PERMADEATH, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE Survival is not guaranteed. Once you die, your character becomes infected and joins the horde of undead shambling through London. You’ll come back as an entirely new character and try to survive, again, with your first mission being to retrieve your previous character’s supplies. BUG-OUT BAG Your bug-out bag holds all your possessions, tools, inventory, first aid kits, maps, and more. Don’t get distracted, as zombies can attack you at any moment. If you die, your bag stays with your old character, who is now a zombie. Will you risk it all to get your bag back, or start scavenging anew?

[Introducing the DOA Series] The DEAD OR ALIVE franchise is a AAA fighting game series produced by Koei Tecmo Games' Team NINJA. Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original DEAD OR ALIVE arcade game in 1996, and have since appeared on a multitude of consoles and arcade machines around the world. In DEAD OR ALIVE 6, the world of DOA is brought back more vibrant than ever, featuring both enhanced visuals and an updated combat systems, aimed to provide the highest possible level of new fighting entertainment. [Story] The story will follow the events of DEAD OR ALIVE 5, focusing on 2 separate main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the events that occur during the 6th DEAD OR ALIVE Tournament. New side story episodes will also be added for returning characters. [The New Visuals] With the help of a new graphics engine, DOA6 aims to bring visual entertainment of fighting games to an entirely new level. The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects. [The Triangle System] Following the tradition, fights in DEAD OR ALIVE 6 are based on a triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage. [New Combat Mechanics - Break System] In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button. [Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors. [New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Korean']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/header.jpg?t=1646807301,http://teamninja-studio.com/doa6/,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/support/,,True,False,False,73,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dead-or-alive-6?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,5403,1986,,36,3320,"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, Partial Nudity, Sexual Content",864,1904,101,1904,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,In-App Purchases,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together",Action,"Fighting,Sexual Content,Action,Nudity,Female Protagonist,Mature,Violent,Multiplayer,Competitive,Anime,3D Fighter,Ninja,Singleplayer,Free to Play,Gore,Great Soundtrack,Arcade,Local Multiplayer,Story Rich,Beat 'em up","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_2461d3a6c2dd2c0fd96dd07ad51af9b2e47f7b6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_0d2bf36eb3ac38da32c2bed7a5206c92beacba3d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_673f3e0df032fbf334feaf272bd9e62359996731.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_1d8581f39413c1f654a8f602cf5951b332f682f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_cfe118cb84ef505db71bb7b772ada6e2446fd02c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_66a519981ec336cbb3f3f1b8bdf4daddcd7426e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_b9a775f96c4bb51ffa56ff83a3cf1e471e634b18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_c67454ba84771bfdc38b5ad6edffc25be2396ff8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256728343/movie_max.mp4?t=1536577350,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256719170/movie_max.mp4?t=1528764286"

A group of terrorists calling themselves The Engineers initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on U.S. interests. Key Features Operate without Restrictions Sam is back in his tactical suit and goggles, and he’s more lethal and agile than ever. Granted the freedom to do whatever it takes to stop the Blacklist, Sam flies from exotic locales to U.S. cities as he races against the clock to find out who’s behind this devastating threat. Own Your Play Style Splinter Cell Blacklist builds on the stealth roots of the franchise, while exploring new directions to embrace the realms of action and adventure. Players can define their personal play styles and be rewarded for those choices. Ghost players want to remain undetected. Assault players rely on instincts and frontal blow to deal with a situation. Panther players look for lethality in the most efficient and silent way. Tools of the Trade Take down The Engineers by using new gadgets such as the upgraded Snake Cam and Micro-trirotor Drone. Splinter Cell Blacklist is also bringing back fan-favorites like the Sticky Shocker and the brutal, curved Karambit knife. Fans of stealth will be happy to make the most of Sam’s sneaking abilities to abduct and carry enemies, while Killing In Motion allows the player to strike with surgical precision by marking and executing multiple enemies in one fluid motion. Build a New Echelon Sam is building a whole new Echelon unit; his team, his way. Anna “Grim” Grimsdottir is his technical operations manager, CIA operative Isaac Briggs brings additional firepower, and resident hacker Charlie Cole rounds out the crew. 4th Echelon is a fully mobile ops unit with unlimited resources and cutting-edge technology aboard the re-purposed stealth airliner, the Paladin. Enjoy a Fully Integrated Experience Sam and his team are aware of terrorist attacks in real time thanks to the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI). The SMI allows 4th Echelon to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. With the SMI, players can take advantage of the universal game economy system that allows players to fully customize and upgrade Sam, his suit, goggles, weapons, the Paladin and much more. Spies vs. Mercs Returns Spies vs. Mercs is back with an new take on asymmetrical gameplay. Players will be able to face off in teams of 4 all the while creating their very own Spy or Merc according to their playstyles via thorough customization elements.

2127,Brutal Legend,X360,2009.0,Action,Electronic Arts,0.62,0.27,0.0,0.09,0.98,Brutal Legend,"Feb 26, 2013",2000000 - 5000000,84,0,14.99,1,"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike. Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs. Story The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off. Combat Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics. Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar. Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual. On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle. A Streaming Open World Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting. Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity. Multiplayer Mayhem 4v4 'skirmish' multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play). Music The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/header.jpg?t=1658527947,http://www.brutallegend.com,http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewforum/10/,support@doublefine.com,True,True,True,80,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brutal-legend?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,15697,1173,,59,8732,,316,0,235,0,Double Fine Productions,Double Fine Productions,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure,Strategy","Action,Comedy,Adventure,Great Soundtrack,Open World,Music,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Third Person,Funny,RTS,Fantasy,Singleplayer,Gothic,Multiplayer,Action-Adventure,Atmospheric,Beat 'em up,RPG,Action RPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_dc08f8689a8f19100c7bd3245d44a4f6aba86fb5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_18d2dd8379122ca826a4e02ba652e7f624d7a79b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_1c1c018a1d7b597bea836eec24dbfe4170ffb069.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_e3bebd4c526ac3a0edff40779e37bfbb5c96893a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_d7bb99be73b6bda558483b81274ea492989a9172.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_83618e23466644e0658e88c2753665a867ae34c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028371/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357433

2131,de Blob,Other,2008.0,Platform,THQ,0.5,0.37,0.0,0.1,0.97,de Blob,"Apr 27, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,19.99,0,"Don't know about art but you know what you like? Whether you are a master of the brush or a finger painting fool, just say no way to gray and join with de Blob and his pals as they launch a color revolution. A mischievous and unlikely hero, only de Blob can flip, bounce and smash his way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation to ignite a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without color. Battle against massive tank battalions, speedy I.N.K.T. racers and elite Inky soldiers on your quest to free the citizens of Chroma City. Avoid hot plates, electric shocks and inky turrets to create your own path to the impenetrable I.N.K.T. Fortress. Just remember that the struggle to reclaim Chroma City is to be fought on your terms. Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future. de Blob is a 3D platformer where players maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies. Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets. Key Features de Blob: Flip, bounce and smash your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation to launch a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without color Long Live Color! Join the Color Revolutionaries in the resistance against Comrade Black and his diabolical array of hot plates, electric shocks, and ink turrets Free The Citizens: Free your friends from a black and white world by painting the city back to life as you dodge ink cannons, flatten I.N.K.T. tanks and outsmart Inky soldiers Multiplayer: Compete to control Chroma City in 4-player split screen in eight different multiplayer modes Save your City: Paint Chroma City's towering skyscrapers, expansive bridges and massive landmarks in your own style using custom colors, patterns and soundtracks Plenty of Play Modes de Blob features both a deep story-driven singleplayer mode where players get to dig into the Raydian's struggle against all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation, as well as a diverse range of multiplayer options. These multiplayer campaigns support up to four players, come with street and sewer maps and include four player split-screen functionality. Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include: Paint Match - Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered. Blob on the Run - A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves. Blob Race - In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow. With time limited it's a race not only to paint the town but also to keep opponents from doing the same.

Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet™: Extreme Condition, the landmark third-person shooter which debuted on Xbox 360 and went on to sell over 2.3 million units worldwide after its release. Lost Planet 2 offers deeper insight into the world of E.D.N III and the uncertain fate of future mankind. Already acclaimed for its visual accomplishments from the console versions, Lost Planet 2 will define the 3D experience on the PC. Stunning environments will immerse the player in NVIDIA Vision Surround technology, and the rebalanced gameplay and streamlined control mechanics make Lost Planet 2 PC the ultimate Lost Planet experience. A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Mankind has engaged in a civil war to take control of the precious Thermal Energy that powers weapons and vehicles on E.D.N. III and resulted in a separation into various factions. Players will control heroes from each faction across 6 interconnected episodes, viewing the war from the perspective of each, creating a truly unique interactive experience. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players’ perspectives. The intense and action-packed campaign mode comes with the ability to form teams of up to 4 players online. Beyond the deep single-player and co-op modes, Lost Planet 2 is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes allowing up to 16 players to compete online, each with their own customizable avatar.

Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. The grappling hooks that made the gameplay in Lost Planet a true 3-D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by moving to elevated locations quickly. Lost Planet 2’s biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are VS that transform into other vehicles, hold up to three players and some that even take multiple players to operate.

See Lost Planet 2’s world through new eyes, with support for hardware tessellation and compute shader. Deep level of character customization: Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look, nom de guerre, emotes, and weapons to truly help them define their character on the battlefield. A wide array of customizable abilities range from taking less damage, to running faster to operating data posts quicker Rewards System: Players will receive rewards for assisting teammates and contributing to the team’s success Multiplayer: Compete in 16-player multiplayer matches with nine different maps and 5 different game modes including Data Post Battle, Akrid Egg Battle, Fugitive, Elimination and Team Elimination.

2187,Brutal Legend,PS3,2009.0,Action,Electronic Arts,0.54,0.28,0.0,0.13,0.95,Brutal Legend,"Feb 26, 2013",2000000 - 5000000,84,0,14.99,1,"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike. Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs. Story The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off. Combat Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics. Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar. Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual. On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle. A Streaming Open World Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting. Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity. Multiplayer Mayhem 4v4 'skirmish' multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play). Music The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/header.jpg?t=1658527947,http://www.brutallegend.com,http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewforum/10/,support@doublefine.com,True,True,True,80,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brutal-legend?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,15697,1173,,59,8732,,316,0,235,0,Double Fine Productions,Double Fine Productions,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure,Strategy","Action,Comedy,Adventure,Great Soundtrack,Open World,Music,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Third Person,Funny,RTS,Fantasy,Singleplayer,Gothic,Multiplayer,Action-Adventure,Atmospheric,Beat 'em up,RPG,Action RPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_dc08f8689a8f19100c7bd3245d44a4f6aba86fb5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_18d2dd8379122ca826a4e02ba652e7f624d7a79b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_1c1c018a1d7b597bea836eec24dbfe4170ffb069.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_e3bebd4c526ac3a0edff40779e37bfbb5c96893a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_d7bb99be73b6bda558483b81274ea492989a9172.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/ss_83618e23466644e0658e88c2753665a867ae34c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658527947",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028371/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357433

Sure, if that’s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN.

The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance. Assassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players. Assassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin. EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin. RENAISSANCE ITALY Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder. A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose.

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

2364,Resident Evil: Revelations,Other,2012.0,Action,Capcom,0.3,0.22,0.3,0.05,0.88,Resident Evil Revelations,"May 20, 2013",1000000 - 2000000,176,17,6.89,6,"Resident Evil ® Revelations returns redefined for PC complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. This latest version of Resident Evil Revelations will also deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode, integration with ResidentEvil.net and improvements to Raid Mode. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. New weapons, skill sets, and playable characters including Hunk, take the Raid Mode experience to new depths. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil ® 4 and Resident Evil ® 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the ‘Queen Zenobia’, where horrors lurk around every corner, before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations. Key Features Enhanced visual and aural fidelity – Resident Evil Revelations brings spine-chilling fear complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. Classic survival horror gameplay returns – the campaign mode’s single player experience sees gamers investigating a range of different locations including the dark confined spaces of a cruise ship and the treacherous snow covered mountains. With limited ammo and weapons, fight off infected enemies that lurk around every corner. Hell just got hotter – Infernal Mode, a new difficulty mode for the re-mastered HD edition, is not just more challenging than Easy and Normal modes but also remixes enemy and item placement, so even those familiar with the game will discover new terrors.

Delivering on the franchise's compelling story, unrivaled authenticity and intense squad-based action, Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway drops you into Operation Market Garden, the largest paratrooper operation in World War II. Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway — next generation: The classic authentic, squad-based combat series explodes on next-generation hardware, offering unprecedented graphics and features. New story, new setting: Join Matt Baker, Joe Hartsock and the rest of the 101st Airborne Division in Operation Market Garden as they fight to open the infamous Hell's Highway in a daring bid for a quick end to the war. Live the life of an enlisted man: Get orders from HQ, go on patrol, spot the enemy and set up a devastating ambush. For the first time, finding the enemy before they find you is part of the challenge. Unprecedented character design: Lifelike characters look, talk, move and think with incredible realism. Game characters interact with the player and each other like true brothers in arms, trading ammunition, helping wounded allies and civilians, working together to man team-operated weapons, and more. Rich cinematic experience: As the squad leader, you interact with and get to know your brothers. Each character has his own distinct personality, unique story and background, and grows throughout the game. Powerful new units under your command: Players can use or command combined arms teams — machine gun crews create intense fire, bazooka crews destroy buildings and tanks, and mortar crews pound the enemy from a distance. Play your own way: Players can choose to use their squad to execute a tactically elegant flanking maneuver or charge in with guns blazing. Destructible cover: Keep your men moving and choose your cover wisely — modeled using real physical properties and behaviors, weapons will damage, dent, scorch and destroy the world around you. Completely new multiplayer experience: Fight major multiplayer battles with dozens of players on each side, combining all the intensity and accessibility of Deathmatch with the squad-based gameplay that helped make Brothers In Arms famous.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/header.jpg?t=1544535852,http://www.brothersinarmsgame.com,,,True,False,False,79,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1433,153,,0,1494,,462,0,536,0,Gearbox Software,Ubisoft,Single-player,Action,"World War II,Action,FPS,Tactical,Singleplayer,Military,Story Rich,Shooter,Gore,Strategy,First-Person,War,Atmospheric,Historical,Multiplayer,Realistic,Controller,Third-Person Shooter","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004434.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004436.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004499.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004497.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004496.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004440.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004442.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004498.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004609.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004610.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/0000004611.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544535852",

Using an enhanced 'Tomb Raider: Legend' game engine, the graphics, technology and physics bring Lara's adventure and pursuit of a mystical artifact known only as the Scion right up to today's technology standards and offers gamers a completely new gameplay experience. Re-imagined, Anniversary delivers a dynamic fluidly and fast Lara Croft, massive environments of stunning visuals, intense combat and game pacing, and an enhanced and clarified original story. Epic Exploration - The lost city of Atlantis and ancient Egyptian pyramids are ripe for discovery: explore every hidden dark crevice and impossible heights; enter into strange, undiscovered lands and solve their deepest, darkest mysteries; open doors to new realms, uncover great rewards and unearth secrets to Lara's past. Acrobatic Gunplay - Deftly leap around charging enemies while you unleash a hail of bullets from your trademark dual pistols. Lethal Predators - The wilderness awaits with a wide range of bestial predatorsfrom bats to wolves to bearsready to defend their territory from human encroachment. New and improved AI means that all enemies will exhibit a more diverse behaviour set, providing improved combat challenges for the player. Supernatural elements are used sparingly to provide a mystical allure around the world, while maintaining the world's grounded core. The awesome T-Rex and intriguing Atlantean centaurs suck you in to the wonderfully intriguing and mysterious world of Tomb Raider. Death-Defying Environmental Playground - Leap over massive gaps, cling onto rock ledges, and swim through underground tunnels. Solve the Diabolical Machinery of the Past - seek to outwit the brilliant ancient designers of many epic puzzles and vaults in order to uncover their secrets. Be warned that they do not take kindly to 'meddling', and as such, the price of failure is extreme.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/header.jpg?t=1592494287,http://www.tombraider.com/anniversary/,,,True,False,False,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,4173,908,,0,4542,,360,0,264,0,Crystal Dynamics,Square Enix,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure","Action,Adventure,Female Protagonist,Puzzle,Third Person,Platformer,Remake,Singleplayer,Classic,Action-Adventure,Dinosaurs,Third-Person Shooter,Exploration,Parkour,Shooter,3D Platformer,Story Rich,Multiplayer,Atmospheric,3D Vision","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/0000002092.1920x1080.jpg?t=1592494287,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/0000002093.1920x1080.jpg?t=1592494287,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/0000002094.1920x1080.jpg?t=1592494287,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/0000002095.1920x1080.jpg?t=1592494287,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/0000002091.1920x1080.jpg?t=1592494287,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8000/0000002096.1920x1080.jpg?t=1592494287",

FIERCE WILDLIFE AND SAVAGE AND MAJESTIC WORLD: This is earth before man laid claim to it, where deadly sabretooth tigers ruled the world, giant woolly mammoths were kings, and herds of massive Elk stormed through the plains. Discover these and many more daunting creatures in the savage open-world of Oros within the towering redwood forests, harsh taiga, cold glacial mountains and humid swamps. In order to enhance your immersion, the entire dialog audio is in a primitive language inspired by Proto-Indo-European, a language that was spoken by our ancestors 12,000 years ago, and subtitled in English.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/header.jpg?t=1638891922,http://far-cry.ubisoft.com/primal/,https://support.ubi.com/,,True,False,False,74,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/far-cry-primal?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,20640,3905,,0,22736,,1012,3,578,3,Ubisoft,Ubisoft,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure","Open World,Survival,Action,Adventure,Hunting,First-Person,Singleplayer,Open World Survival Craft,Crafting,Exploration,FPS,Stealth,Atmospheric,Shooter,Mature,Sandbox,RPG,Action RPG,Strategy,Online Co-Op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_d820e20568ae777eda44fdebe23690e1e5c3d3a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_ba889584f1312c18efc11b8bbea916a9e118272a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_308b86502c1ca398a3f47995ab7a13ff8f0f2050.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_80e2245daaa7180e4c84f4399285af8a4e3a2137.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_6fc6df0e439cf95e4252927f0d79aa473f2de81e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_5c7cae46a6f8ab3fc576164ac5ff758201b555db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_0680579ed4e4ce734c632a7994877e73679731b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_09519977390070d19cbf66981df5eb4f3a168101.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_b26849b80fc001ad55c4e5e87dacb3cf391cfa12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/371660/ss_4994fd2b676f31004630e1b68e601f29a3640c70.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638891922","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256661215/movie_max.mp4?t=1456813035,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256661214/movie_max.mp4?t=1456808606"

Cocked, loaded and ready for action, Duke delivers epic ass-kicking, massive weapons, giant explosions and pure unadulterated fun! Put on your shades and step into the boots of Duke Nukem. The alien hordes are invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses can’t stop this epic hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it. The King arrives with an arsenal of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of interactivity. With hours and hours of action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes, rest assured knowing the fun goes on and on. Story Did the Alien bastards not learn their lesson the first time? Duke has been on hiatus for some time now, kicking back and franchising himself on the fame he gained from saving Earth from the first invasion. The Aliens have returned to Earth yet again, messing up Duke’s sweet routine of dirty leisure habits. The Alien invaders are stealing Earth’s women, especially the hot ones! And they drank Duke’s beer. This. Won’t. Stand. As Duke battles his way through waves of aliens, the once beautiful gambling haven and Duke Nukem franchise chains are crumbling before his eyes. Time to bring the pain! Features Bust a Gut: Duke pulls no punches. Duke’s constant stream of hilarious one-liners throughout the game make this an out loud good time. World Interactivity: Spend as much time as you want shooting hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool, air hockey, and slots.

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

2520,DmC: Devil May Cry,PS3,2013.0,Action,Capcom,0.24,0.28,0.19,0.12,0.82,DmC: Devil May Cry,"Jan 24, 2013",1000000 - 2000000,144,17,29.99,4,"In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action, fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but inject a more brutal and visceral edge. The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory’s expertise and Capcom’s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title. Key Features Survive Limbo - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante. The world will transform in real-time and try to block off and even kill our hero. Our protagonist will have to master demonic powers to shape Limbo the way he sees fit, while perfecting his angelic skills to traverse this hazardous, twisted world. Who is Dante? – Explore a retelling of Dante’s origin story in a gripping narrative featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters, including Vergil, Dante’s twin brother. Unbridled action – The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat returns with the addition of new Angel and Demon weapons and abilities, all designed to dispatch the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache. Weapons include: “Rebellion” : Dante’s trusted sword, given by his father Sparda, provides a great mix of combos and attacks, great for sending enemies skyward. “Ebony &amp; Ivory” : These guns are good for keeping enemies at bay, maintaining combos and juggling enemies in the air. “Arbiter” : a demonic axe that can deliver massive blows and break through enemy shields. “Osiris” : an angelic scythe with fast attacks and great for crowd control. “Eryx” : powerful demonic gauntlets that pack enough punch to parry even the strongest attacks and juggle the heaviest enemies. Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA – Capcom staff, including team members from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry franchise. Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC’s high-octane combat.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Dutch', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian']",“Action at its finest” 8.9/10 – IGN “Superb” 9/10 – Destructoid “A slice of heaven” – Kotaku,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/header.jpg?t=1644283036,http://www.devilmaycry.com/index.php,http://www.capcom.co.jp/support/contact/,,True,False,False,85,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dmc-devil-may-cry?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,22309,1547,,58,14830,,1123,159,360,159,Ninja Theory,Capcom,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Action,Hack and Slash,Great Soundtrack,Spectacle fighter,Demons,Adventure,Third Person,Singleplayer,Character Action Game,Reboot,Controller,Gore,Stylized,Beat 'em up,Atmospheric,Fast-Paced,Comedy,Fantasy,Story Rich,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_5e89cc2ac0468afa40bd9bd6932b41a0db9016f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_4ee2134ba7a118241db88f211660d28bedfc062c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_195b2507916f1e1b075e4dc9cf697bd383219dfd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_9edb3da7e3a6fe2ac99f7964da44894b4d9c8f87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_1f10e8fa05c5f7b89300c05c60730305ceee9e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_2d23e3cdbc7f57af8194868ca8b8727544af88c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_cd23b8020950589416ce7ef30f452fabf3c51079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_b2fbffc94350b832e4b9d3545b4c44d9295467ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_791f867594813372abc05e621047b565142e840e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_82589de563d2dff0dd557b62b617060e84866046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_a25a4920a9c14183600e4b19ef501e44f7e73051.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_89ecbf1b0120d32ff82580f5e3f9f6a76edd7b92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_87ab71b8407b7aaf75bae247e8e2f511f0c80b05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028770/movie_max.mp4?t=1447358028,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028339/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357348,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028280/movie_max.mp4?t=1654549911"

This latest version of Resident Evil Revelations will also deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode, integration with ResidentEvil.net and improvements to Raid Mode. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. New weapons, skill sets, and playable characters including Hunk, take the Raid Mode experience to new depths. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil ® 4 and Resident Evil ® 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the ‘Queen Zenobia’, where horrors lurk around every corner, before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations. Key Features Enhanced visual and aural fidelity – Resident Evil Revelations brings spine-chilling fear complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. Classic survival horror gameplay returns – the campaign mode’s single player experience sees gamers investigating a range of different locations including the dark confined spaces of a cruise ship and the treacherous snow covered mountains. With limited ammo and weapons, fight off infected enemies that lurk around every corner. Hell just got hotter – Infernal Mode, a new difficulty mode for the re-mastered HD edition, is not just more challenging than Easy and Normal modes but also remixes enemy and item placement, so even those familiar with the game will discover new terrors. Meet the Wall Blister – A brand new enemy, the Wall Blister is a mutated creature borne from the T-Abyss virus that spreads through water, adding to the horrors that lurk around every corner. Residentevil.net support – Resident Evil Revelations will take full advantage of Residentevil.net with content available to users once the game launches.

A highly trained special ops unit is sent in to help the rebels accomplish objectives that only a sniper can handle. In addition to intense sniper missions, players will also take part in a variety of assault scenarios where their prowess with weapons will be a huge help to the undermanned rebels. Sniper: Ghost Warrior seeks to challenge players in new ways so that the game is both demanding and entertaining. Developed by City Interactive’s dedicated next-gen games studio, Sniper: Ghost Warrior delivers an impressive visual and technological gaming experience and features a realistic ballistics system that measures bullet trajectory, bullet drop and environmental effects such as wind, fog &amp; rain. Encompassing a wide array of single and multiplayer levels, players will encounter a variety of challenging terrain. Players take on the role of a Ghost Warrior, an elite sniper in a highly trained special ops unit, whose unique skills in the art of stalking, target detection, surveillance and shooting accuracy will determine mission success. Covert missions force players to operate undetected as they attempt to eliminate hostile enemies one head shot at a time. Key Features: The most realistic sniping experience in a video game ever, right down to managing your breathing for increased accuracy of sniper shots. Enjoy a fully realistic ballistic system that accounts for bullet trajectory, including bullet drop and environmental effects such as wind, fog &amp; rain.

Cocked, loaded and ready for action, Duke delivers epic ass-kicking, massive weapons, giant explosions and pure unadulterated fun! Put on your shades and step into the boots of Duke Nukem. The alien hordes are invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses can’t stop this epic hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it. The King arrives with an arsenal of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of interactivity. With hours and hours of action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes, rest assured knowing the fun goes on and on. Story Did the Alien bastards not learn their lesson the first time? Duke has been on hiatus for some time now, kicking back and franchising himself on the fame he gained from saving Earth from the first invasion. The Aliens have returned to Earth yet again, messing up Duke’s sweet routine of dirty leisure habits. The Alien invaders are stealing Earth’s women, especially the hot ones! And they drank Duke’s beer. This. Won’t. Stand. As Duke battles his way through waves of aliens, the once beautiful gambling haven and Duke Nukem franchise chains are crumbling before his eyes. Time to bring the pain! Features Bust a Gut: Duke pulls no punches. Duke’s constant stream of hilarious one-liners throughout the game make this an out loud good time. World Interactivity: Spend as much time as you want shooting hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool, air hockey, and slots. Scale &amp; Variety: Packed with explosive FPS action, outlandish settings, driving, and puzzle solving — gamers will never tire of the endless FUN. Multiplayer Like No Other: Classic modes are re-made with a Duke twist.

2699,Lost Planet 2,X360,2010.0,Shooter,Capcom,0.38,0.24,0.08,0.06,0.76,Lost Planet® 2,"Oct 15, 2010",200000 - 500000,10,0,0.0,0,"The larger than life action of Lost Planet 2 , comes to PC! Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet™: Extreme Condition, the landmark third-person shooter which debuted on Xbox 360 and went on to sell over 2.3 million units worldwide after its release. Lost Planet 2 offers deeper insight into the world of E.D.N III and the uncertain fate of future mankind. Already acclaimed for its visual accomplishments from the console versions, Lost Planet 2 will define the 3D experience on the PC. Stunning environments will immerse the player in NVIDIA Vision Surround technology, and the rebalanced gameplay and streamlined control mechanics make Lost Planet 2 PC the ultimate Lost Planet experience. A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Mankind has engaged in a civil war to take control of the precious Thermal Energy that powers weapons and vehicles on E.D.N. III and resulted in a separation into various factions. Players will control heroes from each faction across 6 interconnected episodes, viewing the war from the perspective of each, creating a truly unique interactive experience. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players’ perspectives. The intense and action-packed campaign mode comes with the ability to form teams of up to 4 players online. Beyond the deep single-player and co-op modes, Lost Planet 2 is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes allowing up to 16 players to compete online, each with their own customizable avatar. No action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and Lost Planet 2 has a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. The grappling hooks that made the gameplay in Lost Planet a true 3-D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by moving to elevated locations quickly. Lost Planet 2’s biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are VS that transform into other vehicles, hold up to three players and some that even take multiple players to operate. Key Features: Co-op action: Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4 player online co-operative play. Teamwork is the player’s key to victory as the team is dependent on each other to succeed and survive. Massive scale of enemies: Players skill on the battlefield and ability to work as a team will be tested like never before against the giant Akrid. Players will utilize teamwork tactics, new weapons and a variety of vital suits (VS) to fight these larger-than-life bosses. Beautiful massive environments: Capcom’s advanced graphics engine, MT Framework 2.0, and DirectX 11 support will bring the game to life with the next step in 3D fidelity and performance. See Lost Planet 2’s world through new eyes, with support for hardware tessellation and compute shader. Deep level of character customization: Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look, nom de guerre, emotes, and weapons to truly help them define their character on the battlefield. A wide array of customizable abilities range from taking less damage, to running faster to operating data posts quicker Rewards System: Players will receive rewards for assisting teammates and contributing to the team’s success Multiplayer: Compete in 16-player multiplayer matches with nine different maps and 5 different game modes including Data Post Battle, Akrid Egg Battle, Fugitive, Elimination and Team Elimination. Additional maps will be available as downloadable content after the game’s release. Exciting new VS features: Based on fan feedback, the team has implemented an unbelievable variety of Vital Suits and new ways to combat VS’s. The new VS system will have a powerful impact on the way the player takes to the war zone in Lost Planet 2.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/header.jpg?t=1636428326,http://www.lostplanetcommunity.com/,http://www.capcom.co.jp/support/contact/,,True,False,False,63,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/lost-planet-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1640,794,,0,2021,,593,0,427,0,"CAPCOM CO., LTD.",Capcom,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure","Action,Co-op,Adventure,Third-Person Shooter,Mechs,Sci-fi,Multiplayer,Third Person,Online Co-Op,Cult Classic,Shooter,Character Customization,Singleplayer,Aliens,Co-op Campaign","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_31ebe9ef0638b7070cde8874f17bd54949e1573d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_12826d07abfe140d530e5b9dff2af5c7c5946bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_6f91dc8ceb4181fb55b7f63cabbdf0de4a19a47c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_327e60c0a5b3a90b59d17bf41071bda2271d45d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_f87b3a62788c70f60444c6d5f1c476903851fdeb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_c4b411eab2ad2146049811a6e223f934d1bd8ec7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_e2784bc6807d227f49b02ec6bc5e20cbc2149a1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_926d4ce526c059ceb5228a46b0de42ae110ae3b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_2dc17aa52d3d4d1c5b7169f97fc4c8be13d64c74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_ee2b6f75957ccda7bdbfaeeb66081f1b670e28be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_6634015ce26af3c9e377d6c67a78a376dfcd5f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_424e2abc2ca387e79347b71b11184aa0ed0579ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_88901375a1975c634b361b4ead50a769d17597f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_ce71290a2e7784eea4f5f802a08c9e883f44a5c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326",

The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game. The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively. Product Features Extensive single player: Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story. Complete two-person co-op: Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay.

Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars. Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge. True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus. Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online. Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race. Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences. Photo-Realistic Cars and Tracks - Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Russian']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/header.jpg?t=1622575105,http://shift.needforspeed.com/home.action,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,2037,615,,0,2409,,618,9,494,9,Slightly Mad Studios,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Multi-player,Partial Controller Support",Racing,"Racing,Automobile Sim,Simulation,Driving,Multiplayer,Controller,Open World,Arcade,Singleplayer,Action,First-Person,Realistic","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_4c36d047c87d6fb871392c82f355527a1886e500.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_b26369c817768059b2fe47dc3b36994a1c6e2afe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_365bb1a8d74958c86d03a9ace6422c26b85f4c71.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_f8dddcbce7e0bc45dc81eb503c7d0b3b600e0cec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_0b05cdeafd5ee7590204f97baed6460b6d20312a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_a49d7527b373c74cafb8f192d87db59133867758.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_31e5db2c5968a9aece22f7800ebe000c8945f446.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_0de76a67a65d07199b3a1c0a60b5e4f546743c79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_57a295c8c6c218b85560be3d221d92306730441a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24870/ss_d329bcab41fbae0a18cbb11d409c8e704955f111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622575105",

2775,Brink,PS3,2011.0,Shooter,Bethesda Softworks,0.29,0.32,0.01,0.12,0.74,BRINK,"May 9, 2011",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,3,"Brink is an immersive first-person shooter that blends single-player, co-op, and multiplayer gameplay into one seamless experience, allowing you to develop your character whether playing alone, with your friends, or against others online. You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more. Brink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose? KEY FEATURES: Not Just Another Hero – Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character – allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique. As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you’ll have even more opportunities for customization. Two Sides to Every Story – Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players. Blurring the Lines – Take your unique character online at any time you choose! Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively. Play SMART – Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button. When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you’re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you’ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART. Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes. You’ll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/header.jpg?t=1573221255,http://brinkthegame.com/,http://support.bethsoft.com/form.php,,True,False,False,70,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brink?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,3657,2383,,43,1861,,0,0,0,0,Splash Damage,Bethesda Softworks,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Free to Play","FPS,Action,Multiplayer,Parkour,Shooter,Character Customization,Free to Play,Class-Based,Co-op,Singleplayer,First-Person,Gun Customization,Team-Based,Online Co-Op,Sci-fi,Tactical,Atmospheric,Open World,Casual,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_ac1ac6b8ef447fa531b4df3c998a6ba1ea1a20ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_52e74a5b88568ab9269dea6382b56b2567d88b67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_d216556d8138fce2ef1e1923c665ea321547a4ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_327fed3215c7c57741325ee6d185ab608e1d3191.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_045b71598ea236bf837644fe8c57d15baee7576f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_beb15921dbcea1392d99e172731ae6c80ba6eb15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_0b66e225a74e0abf335b6f92e2aefc955b105550.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_daac6c250164a89c191237a827d66db4ee940e45.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_9e7deb28aa6ec5d661ec04a6ae01034514bf503c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_d479c288ccbfbfc128cd11a8e790b722a6cac592.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_b04e1953a60b8f4c65373cd4ad3c4b9f478fbe96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_fa5a62c97aa888069b311b89a1fb38dceab9b6b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_78b67f54d5052695e73118a8abe892b1f9d50376.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_7135dd6cdbe09a9a87200688422a157e034a001c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_31a4c523d53f10baebd1c7466940bd67557eec33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_c1f9397f6ccdd980ecb2c93608fbfbce1075885a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_0cf47bdf5f68e44639e4de2aed880a4224d38232.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_aa8a64c821919642ab4ce693436487497558bd0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_8e62d4c86ed26576568b9a97bef6ae3b44352b8f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/22350/ss_f965008ada615248443a08c574a278fe6cf74cf9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573221255",

As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/header.jpg?t=1654830036,http://www.callofduty.com,http://support.activision.com/,,True,False,False,68,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/call-of-duty-ghosts?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,17030,10793,,40,9170,,503,0,296,0,Infinity Ward,Activision,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Dog,FPS,Action,Multiplayer,Shooter,First-Person,Military,Singleplayer,War,Co-op,Online Co-Op,America,Linear,Fast-Paced,Hacking,Survival Horror,Futuristic,Tactical,Team-Based,Competitive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_40eccd8d9da36152496ed7cb625f1b3cde3848ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_4034e8573255a5cca333b42bb78aea9ec05118dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_007e6bb9311b3ebfc9441a6965699abc1f66971c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_f62dec40365369a31ecf04691fcabec9fed042bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_ada57e47a9fc25445a201ee189c3b44017224b42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_d0960fe4c60e578c033d8f5c23636e8808a04c0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030019/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359449,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029955/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359325,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029908/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359288,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029794/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359231,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029788/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359230,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029623/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029593/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359068,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029594/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029595/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029596/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028745/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028743/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028744/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970"

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It’s over to you, boss. Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club’s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs… or face the consequences. Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention. This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.","['English', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'French', 'German', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Greek', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/header.jpg?t=1649698124,http://www.footballmanager.com/,https://support.sega.co.uk/,,True,True,False,0,,0,21654,1550,,98,13945,,16905,228,15789,250,Sports Interactive,SEGA,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Sports","Sports,Simulation,Management,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Soccer,Football,Strategy,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_fd42ad95cb1a3e7d9e48ef393362147210020ba7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_435711f30c32974d611c7015aaa04b5888ae1a83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_e21cf048fc8760c634f4bca91870ef2590485ace.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_0e08de5f60e5a2465c896015368b66ac69056d30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_631773adf9861490d7bf00164775d9ce62d2e4bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6bd99934c734b3021b1d4ce837229a05151c5a72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_acf44b07f87de85d71b387d7382befa23cf9b746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6c4363ceb1ef2db319355784318bb75a3fe5cdd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811823/movie_max.mp4?t=1606827380

In The Witcher, you play as professional monster hunter Geralt of Rivia tasked with finding a child of prophecy in a vast open world rich with merchant cities, pirate islands, dangerous mountain passes, and forgotten caverns to explore. KEY FEATURES PLAY AS A HIGHLY TRAINED MONSTER SLAYER FOR HIRE Trained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength and reflexes, witchers are a counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live. Gruesomely destroy foes as a professional monster hunter armed with a range of upgradeable weapons, mutating potions and combat magic. Hunt down a wide range of exotic monsters — from savage beasts prowling the mountain passes, to cunning supernatural predators lurking in the shadows of densely populated towns. Invest your rewards to upgrade your weaponry and buy custom armour, or spend them away in horse races, card games, fist fighting, and other pleasures the night brings. EXPLORE A MORALLY INDIFFERENT FANTASY OPEN WORLD Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth and complexity. Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains and seas. Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services. Make choices that go beyond good &amp; evil, and face their far-reaching consequences. CHASE DOWN THE CHILD OF PROPHECY Take on the most important contract to track down the child of prophecy, a key to save or destroy this world. In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends. Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds and even a threat from beyond the veil – all hell-bent on controlling this world. Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving. FULLY REALIZED NEXT GENERATION Built exclusively for next generation hardware, the REDengine 3 renders the world of The Witcher visually nuanced and organic, a real true to life fantasy. Dynamic weather systems and day/night cycles affect how the citizens of the towns and the monsters of the wilds behave. Rich with storyline choices in both main and subplots, this grand open world is influenced by the player unlike ever before.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Czech', 'Hungarian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']",“ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE” 10/10 – GameSpot “AMAZING” 9.3/10 – IGN “ONE OF THE BEST RPGs EVER MADE” 9.8/10 – Game Trailers,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/header.jpg?t=1646996408,http://www.thewitcher.com,http://en.cdprojektred.com/support,http://en.cdprojektred.com/contact-support/,True,False,False,93,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,617738,25020,,78,591701,,3696,638,929,112,CD PROJEKT RED,CD PROJEKT RED,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV",RPG,"Open World,RPG,Story Rich,Atmospheric,Mature,Fantasy,Adventure,Singleplayer,Choices Matter,Nudity,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,Medieval,Action,Multiple Endings,Action RPG,Magic,Dark Fantasy,Dark,Sandbox","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_107600c1337accc09104f7a8aa7f275f23cad096.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_64eb760f9a2b67f6731a71cce3a8fb684b9af267.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_eda99e7f705a113d04ab2a7a36068f3e7b343d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_d5b80eb63c12a6484f26796f3e34410651bba068.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_b74d60ee215337d765e4d20c8ca6710ae2362cc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_dc55eeb409d6e187456a8e159018e8da098fa468.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_849ec8dcc6f8df1c0b2c509584c9fc9e51f88cfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_90a33d7764a2d23306091bfcb52265c3506b4fdb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_07812c174bb6b96c29895ddc27404143df7aba6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_ed23139c916fdb9f6dd23b2a6a01d0fbd2dd1a4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_dc33eb233555c13fce939ccaac667bc54e3c4a27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_908485cbb1401b1ebf42e3d21a860ddc53517b08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_608af6cfe0eab3f37265550b391732a3e88d1a4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/292030/ss_8ac1dc847388e59b1be1c5ea5ca592d5861756cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646996408","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256658589/movie_max.mp4?t=1528288687,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2039385/movie_max.mp4?t=1447374875"

In RiFT, you must protect Max, a child with special abilities, and figure out ways to escape from Axion; a heavily guarded science research facility. However, Max becomes weaker whenever he uses his psychokinetic ability as a weapon. And in order to use Max’s ability, the player must have amassed a certain number of kill points. Your primary objective is to escape from the research facility unscathed with Max, so you’ll have to use his abilities only when necessary. The gameplay takes inspiration from the classic “capture the flag” mode but steps it up with intense and thrilling arcade action. Think of the anime AKIRA meets action movie THE RAID.

He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret. Key Features The City in the Sky – Leave the depths of Rapture to soar among the clouds of Columbia. A technological marvel, the flying city is a beautiful and vibrant world that holds a very dark secret. Unlikely Mission – Set in 1912, hired gun Booker DeWitt must rescue a mysterious girl from the sky-city of Columbia or never leave it alive.

Vigorous Powers – Throw explosive fireballs, shoot lightning, and release murders of crows as devastatingly powerful Vigors surge through your body to be unleashed against all that oppose you.

Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage. [New Combat Mechanics - Break System] In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button. [Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors. [New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Korean']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/header.jpg?t=1646807301,http://teamninja-studio.com/doa6/,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/support/,,True,False,False,73,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dead-or-alive-6?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,5403,1986,,36,3320,"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, Partial Nudity, Sexual Content",864,1904,101,1904,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,In-App Purchases,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together",Action,"Fighting,Sexual Content,Action,Nudity,Female Protagonist,Mature,Violent,Multiplayer,Competitive,Anime,3D Fighter,Ninja,Singleplayer,Free to Play,Gore,Great Soundtrack,Arcade,Local Multiplayer,Story Rich,Beat 'em up","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_2461d3a6c2dd2c0fd96dd07ad51af9b2e47f7b6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_0d2bf36eb3ac38da32c2bed7a5206c92beacba3d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_673f3e0df032fbf334feaf272bd9e62359996731.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_1d8581f39413c1f654a8f602cf5951b332f682f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_cfe118cb84ef505db71bb7b772ada6e2446fd02c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_66a519981ec336cbb3f3f1b8bdf4daddcd7426e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_b9a775f96c4bb51ffa56ff83a3cf1e471e634b18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/838380/ss_c67454ba84771bfdc38b5ad6edffc25be2396ff8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646807301","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256728343/movie_max.mp4?t=1536577350,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256719170/movie_max.mp4?t=1528764286"

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named Best PC Game Ever by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial muscles, human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Dutch', 'Danish', 'Finnish', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Swedish', 'Thai']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Thai']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/header.jpg?t=1591063154,http://www.half-life2.com,http://steamcommunity.com/app/220,,True,True,True,96,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/half-life-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,142368,3687,,33,110892,,606,185,311,315,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Includes Source SDK,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play Together",Action,"FPS,Action,Sci-fi,Classic,Singleplayer,Story Rich,Shooter,First-Person,Adventure,Dystopian,Atmospheric,Zombies,Silent Protagonist,Physics,Aliens,Great Soundtrack,Horror,Puzzle,Multiplayer,Moddable","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001864.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001865.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001866.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001867.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001869.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001871.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001872.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/904/movie_max.mp4?t=1569623096,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5724/movie_max.mp4?t=1569623106"

In order to save their family, the McCall brothers will kill anyone who stands between them and the legendary Gold of Juarez. But when the allure of money and women tests their bond, will the blood they share prove to be thicker than water? Become a Gunslinger — Harness an array of weapons, from various revolvers to heavy-caliber cannons and machine guns. Every accurate shot increases your concentration, which allows you to unleash deadly shooting modes when outnumbered — and even deadlier ones when the brothers work together. Brothers in Arms — Choose to embody Ray or Thomas, each with a distinctive gameplay style (close- or long-range), specific abilities (lasso, dynamite, etc.) and arsenal of deadly weapons (dual guns, long-range carbine, etc.). Take advantage of their strengths and you just might survive some of the fiercest fights imaginable. Immersive Western Experience — Explore vast natural landscapes of the untamed mythical Old West on foot, horseback, in wagons and canoes. Visit iconic settings full of outlaws. The McCall brothers face a renegade Apache chief, a greedy Mexican bandit, a vindictive colonel — and those are just a few of the underhanded villains standing in the brothers’ way.

Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge Asylum, where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping further into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her release—yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event. With her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she’ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the “real” world can’t provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge. Can Alice save Wonderland—and herself—from the madness that consumes them both? Key Features: Intense 3rd person action: Use multiple upgradeable melee weapons, including the explosive Teapot Cannon, the punishing Hobby Horse, and the classic Vorpal Blade. Explore a dark and shattered Wonderland: Encounter familiar but now strange characters, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar and the Red Queen. Magical abilities: Obtain peculiar abilities in Wonderland such as floating with Alice’s dress, shrinking, or growing to towering sizes in order to crush enemies.

Now Isaac is cut off, trapped, and engaged in a desperate fight for survival. Strategically dismember the Necromorph enemies limb by bloody limb.

Game Features: Messy monster slaying The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time. Improvised weapons There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed. Real-time attacks. Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack.

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.","['English',

Select one of the 8 unique protagonists and embark on an epic adventure defined by your own choices! Once every 300 years, the Rise of Morastrum—an event where the dark star blocks out the sun—threatens the very existence of our world. All born in that year are doomed to perish before its end. Whether man or beast, none have a chance at survival. However, there came a time when a sole child did survive. He was entranced by the power of death, using it to conquer the world. He came to be known as the Archfiend. Yet one day, he simply vanished. Another 300 years passed, and again a child defied fate. She did not give in to the same powers that controlled the Archfiend, and came to be known as the Matriarch.

Play Rayman Origins and discover or rediscover the magical universe and legendary 2D gameplay that captured the hearts of millions of fans... When the Glade of Dreams is overrun by “nefurrious” Darktoons, the Fairy Council hastily invokes Rayman to save the day; but the hero of light isn’t quite all there…To help him, Rayman teams up with his best friend, Globox, and two crafty wizards, the Teensies. Together, the world’s most hilarious team of heroes will need to restore peace to the Glade, or watch as their beloved home vanishes like a bad dream... Key Features Rebirth of a Platforming Legend: It’s been 15 years since the initial launch of Rayman. Rayman Origins brings back many of the classic characters, revived in their original 2D form, as well as a whole new world of characters and environments. Four-Player, Jump-In/Jump-Out, Co-op Gameplay: Play as Rayman in the solo campaign, or have up to three friends jump in at any time to play as Globox or as one of the two Teensies. Players can leave at any time without affecting the others’ progression. Unique Approach to 2D Art: A rich world with over 100 characters and 12 unique environments created by some of the video gaming’s most reputed artists and animators. This creative approach to 2D design will recapture the hearts of platformer fans and introduce a new generation to one of the industry’s best-loved characters in his original 2D form. A Vast Playground: Rayman Origins includes over 60 levels of 2D platforming gameplay designed for all ages and playing styles. Unlock new abilities progressively and return to previous levels to discover new paths and secrets. Variety of Gameplay: Rayman Origins is a platformer at its core, but it has elements of many game genres. Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies gain unique abilities as they progress through the adventure, including swimming, diving and the sensational “HairlyCopter.” The game also features many elements of action, adventure, and beat-’em-up gameplay. Epic Boss Fights: A giant pink monster with hundreds of eyes... A possessed, mountainous golem... An evil daisy-cum-carnivorous plant...Rayman Origins will put players to the test with these and many more challenging boss battles! A Handful of Highly Talented Artists and Engineers: Rayman Origins was developed by the UBIart team in Montpellier and is built on an open-source game engine - the UBIart Framework - designed by Michel Ancel to allow much smaller teams of artists and developers to produce incredibly high-quality graphics and gameplay quickly and efficiently. This garage-game approach has led to great strides in creativity and innovation.","['Czech', 'Dutch', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'Hungarian', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/header.jpg?t=1617126368,http://www.raymanorigins.com,http://support.ubi.com,,True,False,False,86,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/rayman-origins?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,2931,187,,0,2861,,361,0,334,0,UBIart Montpellier,Ubisoft,"Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Full controller support,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure","Platformer,Local Co-Op,2D,Adventure,Cartoony,Great Soundtrack,Action,Colorful,Funny,Singleplayer,Co-op,Local Multiplayer,Comedy,Controller,4 Player Local,Family Friendly,Side Scroller,Multiplayer,Difficult,Fantasy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/ss_b42ab5cf2976b19253a6efb4d14786b29fe28d5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1617126368,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/ss_2386b31df088bd0266231535e8a6b7266f780330.1920x1080.jpg?t=1617126368,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/ss_85cf202b9edd002623c639bd3a4c5130798c400f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1617126368,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/ss_f416b0515200e79e0216cfda1e59848391991aa3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1617126368,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/ss_d2e8397794c352bc1367f57dd8e12ea92ef916dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1617126368,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207490/ss_f8985b35ffba2cbaf1b3e1e1b241246222bcf4ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1617126368",

BlazBlue is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as 'the Library,' which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways. A round is called a 'rebel' and one match can consist of one to five 'rebels'. To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent's health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a 'unique' technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character. Key Features 12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager. Drive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent. Depending on the character control the elements like wind and ice or even absorb the life force from your opponents. Experience the beauty of high-resolution hand-drawn sprites on 3D backgrounds all in glorious high-definition.

The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance. Assassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players. Assassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin. EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin. RENAISSANCE ITALY Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder. A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose. DYNAMIC CROWD Discover a living, breathing world where every character is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with the crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide ample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences. BECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN Perfect your skills to become a master assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to disarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and assassinate enemies using both hidden blades.

Honour, sacrifice, betrayal … Your choices make you who you are. How will history remember you? You must wield the sword of a mysterious lone samurai during Japan’s turbulent Sengoku era, in one of the most atmospheric action RPGs ever created. Explore the villages, body-strewn battlefields, bandit fortresses, immense castles and local town of Amana, in an open world bustling with a rich cast of colourful characters that you can help, ignore or victimise. Choose your friends and enemies carefully in a game where every decision has far-reaching consequences, and where finishing the game is just the beginning of your journey… • The Butterfly Effect – More than 20 different endings. Your every action, no matter how subtle or ludicrous, could set in motion a huge variety of events, allowing for huge replayability. Explore new narrative paths, reveal new allies… and enemies! • Huge Customization - Craft your own unique weapons from over 200 different parts. Create the ultimate unbreakable weapon to suit your preferred fighting style. Forge lethal swords, spears, pole axes and more outlandish weaponry and discover hundreds of new abilities as you become a true master of each weapon! • Reward System and Samurai Rating – Your actions and conduct will reward you with Samurai Points and Titles, all of which unlock new game features, customisation options, outfits and accessories. Live as an honourable samurai, wallow in the low life of a bandit or strike your own path! Your choices lead to new endings, strange followers and other unexpected outcomes. • The Pen Can Be Mightier Than the Sword - Fight your enemies by force or take the diplomatic route, using subtle gestures like the unsheathing of your sword or kowtowing. Featuring an extensive dialogue tree, combo system and much, much more! What the reviewers had to say about the PS3 version: “Anyone who likes swordfighting, the freedom of an open-world, and the opportunity to shape a story would be well-advised to pick it up.” – Cheat Code Central “You're free to do whatever you want… you're encouraged to play it over and over again and try different things each time. Again, I think this design is great.” – IGN “Multiple endings, tons of weapon customization and plenty of replay offer up a package that is a must buy for fans of the first two games.” - ZTGD","['English', 'French', 'German']","['English', 'German']","“I can in full confidence say though, that I've never played a more interesting open world title.” 4/5 – Digitally Downloaded “Generously stuffed with quirky humour, a real love for the period and more longevity than you can shake a bottle of sake at, Way of the Samurai 3 is certainly the best in the series and an easy recommendation to folks looking to lose themselves in a very different sort of adventure.” 8.5/10 – Game Watcher “If you’re looking for a fantastic Japanese game about Samurai’s then this is certainly it. It’s got the perfect level of humour and seriousness.

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

With Dishonored’s flexible combat system, creatively eliminate your targets as you combine the supernatural abilities, weapons and unusual gadgets at your disposal. Pursue your enemies under the cover of darkness or ruthlessly attack them head on with weapons drawn. The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make. Story: Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk- inspired technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows. You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever. Key features: Improvise and Innovate Approach each assassination with your own style of play. Use shadow and sound to your advantage to make your way silently through levels unseen by foes, or attack enemies head-on as they respond to your aggression. The flexible combat system allows you to creatively combine your abilities, supernatural powers and gadgets as you make your way through the levels and dispatch your targets. Improvise and innovate to define your play style. Action with Meaning The world of Dishonored reacts to how you play. Move like a ghost and resist corruption, or show no mercy and leave a path of destruction in your wake. Decide your approach for each mission, and the outcomes will change as a result. Supernatural Abilities Teleport for stealth approaches, possess any living creature, or stop time itself to orchestrate unearthly executions! Combining your suite of supernatural abilities and weapons opens up even more ways to overcome obstacles and eliminate targets. The game’s upgrade system allows for the mastery of deadly new abilities and devious gadgets. A City Unlike Any Other Enter an original world envisioned by Half-Life 2 art director Viktor Antonov. Arkane and Bethesda bring you a steampunk city where industry and the supernatural collide, creating an atmosphere thick with intrigue.

Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge Asylum, where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping further into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her release—yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event. With her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she’ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the “real” world can’t provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge. Can Alice save Wonderland—and herself—from the madness that consumes them both? Key Features: Intense 3rd person action: Use multiple upgradeable melee weapons, including the explosive Teapot Cannon, the punishing Hobby Horse, and the classic Vorpal Blade.

Prepare to Make a Killing. When assassins from Agent 47's contract agency, The ICA, are eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger, more powerful agency has entered the fray. Sensing he may be a target, 47 travels to America, and prepares to make a killing. 'Blood Money' system: the cleaner the 'hit' the more money you receive which can be spent on bribing witnesses and police to reduce your notoriety, weapon customisation, specialist equipment and information. Customisable weapons: modify Agent 47's custom weapons in a variety of ways including sound, recoil, rate of fire, damage, reload speed, accuracy and zoom. Strong narrative: who is wiping out the ICA and what is their motivation? New engine: the world of the assassin has never been so interactive or looked so good! New gameplay techniques: including disarm, distraction, accidents, body disposal, human shield and decoy weapons. New control and camera system: Agent 47 now moves independently of the camera. New moves: Agent 47 can now climb, hide, scale ledges and automatically pass low obstacles. Improved AI: guards will follow blood trails, investigate suspicious items and behaviour. New pathfinder engine provides improved tracking and movement with realistic enemy behaviour and interaction.

A brilliantly polished slice of nostalgia, Destroy All Humans! knows exactly where to focus its energies with its silly story, updated gameplay and a graphical overhaul that is light-years ahead of the original invasion.” 8.5/10 – Critical Hit",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/header.jpg?t=1642581122,https://destroyallhumansgame.com/,,support@quanticlab.com,True,False,False,0,,0,7741,544,,40,6606,,394,0,282,0,"Black Forest Games,Pandemic Studios",THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Tablet","Action,Adventure","Action,Adventure,Villain Protagonist,Aliens,Remake,Open World,Singleplayer,Funny,Sci-fi,Comedy,Cult Classic,Third Person,Gore,Third-Person Shooter,Destruction,Dark Humor,Classic,Sandbox,Violent,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_7da9673923fbe10147ab48c9e2d39e4ce2868c7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_394f931e0d2487158840e77b6093c2510b30453d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_292d9dff014f3ace5e32619ffcd2c6c3b1d67061.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_33f79b636bbc33fc2465c83a4c391ac0ee23bd81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_4c03373a188ecf68c69a7f92dd47fdaffb05c620.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_114c6b73e912cb8332197a86fdee2393789a9696.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_9b4ec63392c9df7394e00202a3aab48ec0ea0d09.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_86fdd386fbb6266e4bdc7f539a151f51a6d60235.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_d49d50756a9234751770c1024cd9a36f4ff1e812.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_a70acd711cd452965e4b208e88eff8d8c4497540.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_84847eb4abaa03ac1410e3d32a7af56d0a453b8a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_a714c0c487da2f7c1fb536cac9e1e713244d6ddd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_49ec775d794447648ceff25b4caefe1222c86847.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_ecc35296aa01260460a2f2eccc2a8c186ebd9b9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_12943e63a06d22262ab129b7ab4dd455676d5d75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_0f863a35ee6a71d29597ac3d9f8c2b62149691a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_2694d2bf653f11f2859dc7c789925df7a59f4495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_f6d3b963effc8e0778d770dd5f62dbe964c46f78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_7d2bbc888612b79ab9a3374b6a02dc6f6d71ab60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_11fa776dd2954650b5644f5ee31931d000aa62da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_e0093fa085fa9291562976107d9ec31755ba5b06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_9e8903587937b2d883fcaa9a95a95cb36d79c103.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_20df107809e6439fa19e676ec6a4a6f4ea5b4bad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_b3097dd9268902c297d761638a96c7058e20089e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_634807fc0ebf710f2586f5fe6947d41aee27887f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_4764cf7610c869a1a1ca880a93b4a6497556e226.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_0a55939059f75fd7989cece010e0428b4fcdaa67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_f7a39bb331a11b6df22311690484245c3162a238.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_3b44831352660795561ff62a70b8d89bd0caf39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/803330/ss_b4f23a564af2f0487f790347430f0f4c0b4cf72a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642581122","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256823764/movie_max.mp4?t=1614345669,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256794248/movie_max.mp4?t=1595953548,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256824260/movie_max.mp4?t=1614872401,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256783513/movie_max.mp4?t=1595953564,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256752869/movie_max.mp4?t=1596804125"

In Football Manager 2021 , dynamic, true-to-life management experiences and next-level detail renews that focus on you, the manager, equipping you with all the tools you need to achieve elite status. With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It’s over to you, boss. Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club’s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs… or face the consequences. Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention. This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.","['English', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'French', 'German', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Greek', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/header.jpg?t=1649698124,http://www.footballmanager.com/,https://support.sega.co.uk/,,True,True,False,0,,0,21654,1550,,98,13945,,16905,228,15789,250,Sports Interactive,SEGA,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Sports","Sports,Simulation,Management,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Soccer,Football,Strategy,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_fd42ad95cb1a3e7d9e48ef393362147210020ba7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_435711f30c32974d611c7015aaa04b5888ae1a83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_e21cf048fc8760c634f4bca91870ef2590485ace.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_0e08de5f60e5a2465c896015368b66ac69056d30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_631773adf9861490d7bf00164775d9ce62d2e4bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6bd99934c734b3021b1d4ce837229a05151c5a72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_acf44b07f87de85d71b387d7382befa23cf9b746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1263850/ss_6c4363ceb1ef2db319355784318bb75a3fe5cdd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649698124",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811823/movie_max.mp4?t=1606827380

[Introducing the DOA Series] The DEAD OR ALIVE franchise is a AAA fighting game series produced by Koei Tecmo Games' Team NINJA. Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original DEAD OR ALIVE arcade game in 1996, and have since appeared on a multitude of consoles and arcade machines around the world. In DEAD OR ALIVE 6, the world of DOA is brought back more vibrant than ever, featuring both enhanced visuals and an updated combat systems, aimed to provide the highest possible level of new fighting entertainment. [Story] The story will follow the events of DEAD OR ALIVE 5, focusing on 2 separate main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the events that occur during the 6th DEAD OR ALIVE Tournament. New side story episodes will also be added for returning characters. [The New Visuals] With the help of a new graphics engine, DOA6 aims to bring visual entertainment of fighting games to an entirely new level. The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects. [The Triangle System] Following the tradition, fights in DEAD OR ALIVE 6 are based on a triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage. [New Combat Mechanics - Break System] In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button. [Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors. [New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage.

Fight together or die alone on a deadly mission to confront your twisted mother. Players can take on the role of Point Man, a genetically enhanced soldier with superhuman reflexes and the ability to manipulate time, or the undead spirit of his brother Paxton Fettel, a paranormal entity who possesses incredible psychic powers. Key Features Blood Runs Deep, F.E.A.R. Runs Deeper: F.E.A.R. 3 delivers all the hallmarks that define the F.E.A.R. brand: terrifying paranormal experience, frenetic combat and a dramatic storyline. Never Face Fear Alone: F.E.A.R. 3 evolves the brand, introducing Divergent Co-op: deep, social gameplay that gives players distinctly different abilities that affect their own play as well as the experience of gamers they are playing with… or against. Frenetic Combat: Active 360 degree cover, evolutionary slow-mo modes, scoring systems and best in class mech- combat aid players in facing an army of soldiers and paranormal enemies. Experience the Almaverse: The game world is tainted by the Almaverse, the alternate dimension where Alma’s psychic essence subsists. New sinister and fantastical enemy creatures birthed in Alma’s warped mind spill into reality and intensify the panic. Generative System: Proprietary technology creates random events to increase the feeling of isolation and unpredictability when playing alone or with a friend, and offers new experiences each time gamers play through. Masters of Horror: Legendary film director John Carpenter and writer Steve Niles provide their expertise and guidance to take F.E.A.R. 3 ’s intensity to the next level. Niles co-wrote the twisted storyline that reveals the motivations and family dynamics of the main characters, and Carpenter helped craft the cinematics for maximum storytelling and fright factor.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/21100/header.jpg?t=1461103386,http://www.whatisfear.com/,,support@wbgames.com,True,False,False,74,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fear-3?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,7498,2905,,50,5192,,264,0,150,0,Day 1 Studios,Warner Bros.

When the massive Terraformer that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and weather is destroyed, the atmosphere turns to chaos, super-tornados and lightning storms engulf the planet. To survive, the Colonists flee to the underground mines and build a network of habitable caves. Five years later, Darius Mason , grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya , runs a lucrative business from Bastion, underground hub of Colonist activity. Mining, scavenging, mercenary work--if the job is dangerous, Darius is your man. Few sane people now venture to the ravaged surface, aside from contractors like Darius and the smugglers who run goods between the settlements. When Darius is tricked into reopening a mysterious shaft in an old Marauder temple, he releases a long-dormant evil and unleashes Armageddon on Mars. As Colonist and Marauder settlements are torn asunder, only Darius and the Red Faction can save mankind. The battle will take them across the storm-blasted planet--and below it, to the very heart of the unspeakable threat. Red Faction®: Armageddon™ expands on the critically acclaimed, best-selling franchise with new, groundbreaking challenges. You are humanity’s last hope for survival. Key features: Infestation Mode – Survive waves of enemy hordes in a 1-4 player cooperative, objective-based experience. Ruin Mode – Master the tools of destruction in competitive and casual destruction-based modes. Hell on Mars – Darius Mason can only watch as the surface of Mars is destroyed. Seeking solace underground, an even greater threat emerges against humanity. Nano Forge – Unleash the devastating force of the Nano Forge with massive concussive blasts or reconstruct downed colonist defences with Geo-Mod 2.0. Martian Underground – The truth behind an ancient evil will force Darius to wage a battle across the devastated Martian surface, beneath massive frozen glaciers, and over rivers of broiling magma.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/header.jpg?t=1591105530,http://www.redfaction.com/,http://faq.deepsilver.com/,,True,False,False,75,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/red-faction-armageddon?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,3169,1196,,58,2232,,296,0,137,0,Volition,Deep Silver,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards",Action,"Action,Destruction,Sci-fi,Third Person,Third-Person Shooter,Singleplayer,Shooter,Mars,Co-op,Aliens,Multiplayer,Adventure,Linear,Open World,FPS,Horror,Physics,Gore","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_3de60777c06c7893741c51f1bc7f213ab1be9728.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_987738ad4ef70878637714fc333498a89a239988.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_2bebc85ddbb12aba20b0f1d686bcba94b75958cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_1edff37080c8e6d8cf35aea6e3cef2d6f67a2128.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_bb5edd024e5d54146a8888f7fd52ab839c38aff3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_26ebb6ff2155b91df1c3e0d79cfb9f5de04aaab1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_b4bd399ee5578062a79d93fe9eba5617a1ab063a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_cb6cc778978ecc16de57b2bae5326b90038c513c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_83f225151c339c921f3734e8031b98a1c247a7fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_1ae20f02fb727b2a2cc46634251df177df242219.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_8fdc9b26b7ee5dbe96d16f5af37ff983811e08c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530",

Fight together or die alone on a deadly mission to confront your twisted mother. Players can take on the role of Point Man, a genetically enhanced soldier with superhuman reflexes and the ability to manipulate time, or the undead spirit of his brother Paxton Fettel, a paranormal entity who possesses incredible psychic powers. Key Features Blood Runs Deep, F.E.A.R. Runs Deeper: F.E.A.R. 3 delivers all the hallmarks that define the F.E.A.R. brand: terrifying paranormal experience, frenetic combat and a dramatic storyline. Never Face Fear Alone: F.E.A.R. 3 evolves the brand, introducing Divergent Co-op: deep, social gameplay that gives players distinctly different abilities that affect their own play as well as the experience of gamers they are playing with… or against. Frenetic Combat: Active 360 degree cover, evolutionary slow-mo modes, scoring systems and best in class mech- combat aid players in facing an army of soldiers and paranormal enemies. Experience the Almaverse: The game world is tainted by the Almaverse, the alternate dimension where Alma’s psychic essence subsists. New sinister and fantastical enemy creatures birthed in Alma’s warped mind spill into reality and intensify the panic. Generative System: Proprietary technology creates random events to increase the feeling of isolation and unpredictability when playing alone or with a friend, and offers new experiences each time gamers play through.

Travelling the world via magical portals to foil the evil plans of Set. Sphinx's Journey will require all his wits, agility, and special powers. He will also rely on his reluctant hero friend, The Mummy, to help when being inconspicuous is the only solution. By finding the stolen magical crowns of Egypt, Sphinx can stop Set and save the world. Features: Use Sphinx and his increasing array of skills to face deadly mythical monsters while avoiding perilous traps with acrobatic ease. Weaken enemies and use capture beetles to store and unleash their abilities at will. Take control the Mummy when strength &amp; combat skills aren't needed — use the Mummy's stealth and unconventional antics to avoid enemies, solve puzzles and sabotage right under the enemy's nose. Interact with hundreds of unique and imaginative creatures, enemies and allies. Fantastic graphics bring this mythical world based on Egyptian legends to life. Totally immersive storyline and epic gameplay. The Story: An ancient Egyptian Universal Empire once joined several worlds through Solar Disc portals. The old empire was destroyed and the civilizations in each world have suffered different fates, some of them have continued contact and others have lost it. These worlds have been separated for such a long time that many of them would not recognize each other. The legend says that two forces, one negative, one positive, are trying to recover the old empire and all of its crowns again. But we know very little about these forces or if they really exist. Other people are simply trying to understand what happened and the real nature of each world. Meanwhile each world continues with it’s own way and history. Recently, strange things have been happening… News is received from many places that problems are appearing; the normally peaceful villages are now at war, odd monsters appear in valleys where there was once placid ecology... Nobody knows why… The chain of communication between the worlds remains partially abandoned, partially destroyed and so unstable that to use it is a sure way to cause even more problems and dangers. A long time ago the Great Wall in Heliopolis was built to protect the civilians. Many people have used the portals but disappeared without trace. For this reason you never know how you will be received in any of the locations or if you will get anywhere at all.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Korean']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/header.jpg?t=1648917768,,,support@quanticlab.com,True,True,True,0,,0,401,30,,34,377,,1023,0,1023,0,"Eurocom,THQ Nordic",THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Captions available,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Adventure,RPG","Adventure,RPG,Singleplayer,Mythology,Third Person,Classic,3D Platformer,Action-Adventure,Puzzle-Platformer,Great Soundtrack,Cartoony,Cult Classic,Colorful,Moddable,Level Editor,Open World,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_6e67ba81b1fab103a7892c43f7dff8924f3d9796.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_828947eb373be0e72c923994547f2326a5b6d699.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_af8de3f56a97b5b5643d0ba47aaa2aba7ff53885.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_9e2fd8223663bb0a71f6f9100302a16c510336ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_175167d58cd60129ea128aa7a8371463bdfc707e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_305f81ec950d6a91f49d9e8a241318f0de437cfe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_5c57e71bae32c48e20822f0cb2b3026fe159ee8f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_129ba60506ccd20f87ecb59deb264702b7346b4c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/606710/ss_220abba7f5857f59da4638750ce7019ddb15a977.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648917768","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256700723/movie_max.mp4?t=1510318272,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256741945/movie_max.mp4?t=1548997805"

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.","['English',

4431,DmC: Devil May Cry,X360,2013.0,Action,Capcom,0.26,0.13,0.01,0.04,0.44,DmC: Devil May Cry,"Jan 24, 2013",1000000 - 2000000,144,17,29.99,4,"In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action, fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but inject a more brutal and visceral edge. The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory’s expertise and Capcom’s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title. Key Features Survive Limbo - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante. The world will transform in real-time and try to block off and even kill our hero. Our protagonist will have to master demonic powers to shape Limbo the way he sees fit, while perfecting his angelic skills to traverse this hazardous, twisted world. Who is Dante? – Explore a retelling of Dante’s origin story in a gripping narrative featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters, including Vergil, Dante’s twin brother. Unbridled action – The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat returns with the addition of new Angel and Demon weapons and abilities, all designed to dispatch the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache. Weapons include: “Rebellion” : Dante’s trusted sword, given by his father Sparda, provides a great mix of combos and attacks, great for sending enemies skyward. “Ebony &amp; Ivory” : These guns are good for keeping enemies at bay, maintaining combos and juggling enemies in the air. “Arbiter” : a demonic axe that can deliver massive blows and break through enemy shields. “Osiris” : an angelic scythe with fast attacks and great for crowd control. “Eryx” : powerful demonic gauntlets that pack enough punch to parry even the strongest attacks and juggle the heaviest enemies. Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA – Capcom staff, including team members from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry franchise. Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC’s high-octane combat.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Dutch', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian']",“Action at its finest” 8.9/10 – IGN “Superb” 9/10 – Destructoid “A slice of heaven” – Kotaku,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/header.jpg?t=1644283036,http://www.devilmaycry.com/index.php,http://www.capcom.co.jp/support/contact/,,True,False,False,85,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dmc-devil-may-cry?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,22309,1547,,58,14830,,1123,159,360,159,Ninja Theory,Capcom,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Action,Hack and Slash,Great Soundtrack,Spectacle fighter,Demons,Adventure,Third Person,Singleplayer,Character Action Game,Reboot,Controller,Gore,Stylized,Beat 'em up,Atmospheric,Fast-Paced,Comedy,Fantasy,Story Rich,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_5e89cc2ac0468afa40bd9bd6932b41a0db9016f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_4ee2134ba7a118241db88f211660d28bedfc062c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_195b2507916f1e1b075e4dc9cf697bd383219dfd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_9edb3da7e3a6fe2ac99f7964da44894b4d9c8f87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_1f10e8fa05c5f7b89300c05c60730305ceee9e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_2d23e3cdbc7f57af8194868ca8b8727544af88c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_cd23b8020950589416ce7ef30f452fabf3c51079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_b2fbffc94350b832e4b9d3545b4c44d9295467ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_791f867594813372abc05e621047b565142e840e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_82589de563d2dff0dd557b62b617060e84866046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_a25a4920a9c14183600e4b19ef501e44f7e73051.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_89ecbf1b0120d32ff82580f5e3f9f6a76edd7b92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220440/ss_87ab71b8407b7aaf75bae247e8e2f511f0c80b05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644283036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028770/movie_max.mp4?t=1447358028,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028339/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357348,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028280/movie_max.mp4?t=1654549911"

Dawn of Man is a survival/city-builder from the creators of Planetbase . The game starts in the Stone Age , and takes you up to the Iron Age , spanning more than 10,000 years of human prehistory. You will have to get your people to survive, expand and evolve, just like our ancestors, facing the challenges that the environment will throw at you. Hunt Animals were a vital source of food and resources for ancient humans. Use their meat to feed your people and their skin and bones to make clothing and craft the tools you will need to stay alive. Confront Mammoths , Woolly Rhinos , Ancient Bison , Megaloceros , Cave Lions and other species that roamed the earth at the time. Gather Collect a variety resources from the environment: fruit, berries, water, wood, flint, stone, ores. Use them to prepare food, to make tools and to build structures in your settlement. Plan for harsh times Fish is more abundant in spring, berries and fruit can be collected in summer and animals are easier to come by when it's warm. When winter comes, make sure to have enough non-perishable food and warm clothing in order to survive. Expand and fortify your settlement Build more homes and facilities for your people, in order to expand your population. Construct fortifications and craft weapons, so you are ready for when the inevitable conflict comes. Research Technologies Each new discovery will make it easier for your settlement to be able to support larger populations, but will also bring new challenges: increased food demand, morale issues and more frequent raider attacks. Build Megalithic Structures Our ancestors were capable of incredible engineering feats: mine massive rocks from the environment, transport them using sledges and construct colossal stone structures. Control Nature Unlock farming technologies to grow your own vegetables, so you can feed large amounts of people. Domesticate animals to produce food, resources and provide increased muscle power.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],"“Dawn Of Man’s great triumph is that, a dozen hours after I’d picked my first berry, forging my first iron sword felt like an immortal accomplishment.” Rock Paper Shotgun",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/header.jpg?t=1629970754,http://madrugaworks.com/dawnofman,http://madrugaworks.com/dawnofman/faq.php,,True,True,False,0,,0,12273,1848,,24,13508,,4014,0,797,0,Madruga Works,Madruga Works,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop","Indie,Simulation,Strategy","City Builder,Colony Sim,Strategy,Survival,Simulation,Historical,Sandbox,Singleplayer,Economy,Indie,Open World,Choices Matter,RTS,Casual,Story Rich,Destruction,Multiplayer,Nudity,Resource Management,Political","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_65c2741a895ef26b352a9363bc214cf8f1a48a48.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_76c9623ef49699be812227e35237106fee6ffece.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_231b362ae6c31bc988adec0da2c12292785786a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_a4ee4e262bfc70f3052fba6ade8e33d517105644.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_faf19d81e647aa582245a022f6f5924352c5f480.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_bf2912d52bed9dfcae2b704ec07bfbf72ea4ed14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_ea30d5faaedf2a031631500bb3f3ca41f3a5f8ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_83295e79276364fcb7da6615523bc661047a7d39.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_daa14d8e6b185500e390e2ade2d97233c48be55c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_f1b6b67ffb38c6b74db8e1fbd79036f98d9de7d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_983cddf2e95f4c8f962fed51ffbcb8c05ba7668c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_68f7e45768525ec99498fd9405e8fce974cbfe36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_2fb0ff284e4d5f7972a5c414ca279ce665031e9e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_16dd26ced7b475f0883ef6443575eb3e68e7533b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_a48db021af80ccba49255e0486150f85165b1b0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_9022abc4e2bd025f620fbecf3168bf9c3af9efd5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_4b991bc7d4258a9a9a89b16f1fbc93bc583d8943.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858810/ss_0a96e77ee1a727065297b34996e17e311d33f6c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629970754",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760905/movie_max.mp4?t=1567413969

Injectable plasmids give you super human powers: blast electrical currents into water to electrocute multiple enemies, or freeze them solid and obliterate them with the swing of a wrench. No encounter ever plays out the same, and no two gamers will play the game the same way.

Cocked, loaded and ready for action, Duke delivers epic ass-kicking, massive weapons, giant explosions and pure unadulterated fun! Put on your shades and step into the boots of Duke Nukem. The alien hordes are invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses can’t stop this epic hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it. The King arrives with an arsenal of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of interactivity. With hours and hours of action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes, rest assured knowing the fun goes on and on. Story Did the Alien bastards not learn their lesson the first time? Duke has been on hiatus for some time now, kicking back and franchising himself on the fame he gained from saving Earth from the first invasion. The Aliens have returned to Earth yet again, messing up Duke’s sweet routine of dirty leisure habits. The Alien invaders are stealing Earth’s women, especially the hot ones! And they drank Duke’s beer. This. Won’t. Stand. As Duke battles his way through waves of aliens, the once beautiful gambling haven and Duke Nukem franchise chains are crumbling before his eyes. Time to bring the pain! Features Bust a Gut: Duke pulls no punches. Duke’s constant stream of hilarious one-liners throughout the game make this an out loud good time. World Interactivity: Spend as much time as you want shooting hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool, air hockey, and slots. Scale &amp; Variety: Packed with explosive FPS action, outlandish settings, driving, and puzzle solving — gamers will never tire of the endless FUN. Multiplayer Like No Other: Classic modes are re-made with a Duke twist. Shrink, squash, freeze and shatter your opponents, or just frag them with a rocket.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/header.jpg?t=1573065360,http://www.dukenukemforever.com,http://support.2k.com/home,,True,True,False,54,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,6212,2935,,62,4895,,411,0,304,0,Gearbox Software,2K,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards",Action,"FPS,Action,Nudity,Shooter,Aliens,Singleplayer,Comedy,Multiplayer,Sci-fi,First-Person,Mature,Funny,Gore,Dark Humor,Classic,Adventure,Memes,Old School,Linear,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_43b85e511818da6802e08e22fd3d9d4c48cfe566.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_a1115b6b3757bb29a75638624c9ee7f83d64ab79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_d75fa0bed827f421eecb2225a428fab509ecf7f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_d054069d283b7defd36e1d2d0b9e08c0585dd2e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_582d42654501fe102b7af58b49b99049850da1db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_17b93d286f888a2327ea716668169074e833ca87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_41a124d388bbe1fde72fe82247b5770b198bfde2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_1cd3661d07bf12e3e1ce00e53c75e04b6da4a68c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_e56812cb5317ff1bb518152a74b1b37e98ce00a7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_172cb2bb0ddfb5ff7a866a0f6aa6a1989d03a92e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/57900/ss_79e24ea74f98142069964d4d07eabc41b3e03d29.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573065360",

Prepare to Make a Killing. When assassins from Agent 47's contract agency, The ICA, are eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger, more powerful agency has entered the fray. Sensing he may be a target, 47 travels to America, and prepares to make a killing. 'Blood Money' system: the cleaner the 'hit' the more money you receive which can be spent on bribing witnesses and police to reduce your notoriety, weapon customisation, specialist equipment and information. Customisable weapons: modify Agent 47's custom weapons in a variety of ways including sound, recoil, rate of fire, damage, reload speed, accuracy and zoom. Strong narrative: who is wiping out the ICA and what is their motivation? New engine: the world of the assassin has never been so interactive or looked so good! New gameplay techniques: including disarm, distraction, accidents, body disposal, human shield and decoy weapons. New control and camera system: Agent 47 now moves independently of the camera. New moves: Agent 47 can now climb, hide, scale ledges and automatically pass low obstacles. Improved AI: guards will follow blood trails, investigate suspicious items and behaviour. New pathfinder engine provides improved tracking and movement with realistic enemy behaviour and interaction.

When the massive Terraformer that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and weather is destroyed, the atmosphere turns to chaos, super-tornados and lightning storms engulf the planet. To survive, the Colonists flee to the underground mines and build a network of habitable caves. Five years later, Darius Mason , grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya , runs a lucrative business from Bastion, underground hub of Colonist activity. Mining, scavenging, mercenary work--if the job is dangerous, Darius is your man. Few sane people now venture to the ravaged surface, aside from contractors like Darius and the smugglers who run goods between the settlements. When Darius is tricked into reopening a mysterious shaft in an old Marauder temple, he releases a long-dormant evil and unleashes Armageddon on Mars. As Colonist and Marauder settlements are torn asunder, only Darius and the Red Faction can save mankind. The battle will take them across the storm-blasted planet--and below it, to the very heart of the unspeakable threat. Red Faction®: Armageddon™ expands on the critically acclaimed, best-selling franchise with new, groundbreaking challenges. You are humanity’s last hope for survival. Key features: Infestation Mode – Survive waves of enemy hordes in a 1-4 player cooperative, objective-based experience. Ruin Mode – Master the tools of destruction in competitive and casual destruction-based modes. Hell on Mars – Darius Mason can only watch as the surface of Mars is destroyed. Seeking solace underground, an even greater threat emerges against humanity. Nano Forge – Unleash the devastating force of the Nano Forge with massive concussive blasts or reconstruct downed colonist defences with Geo-Mod 2.0. Martian Underground – The truth behind an ancient evil will force Darius to wage a battle across the devastated Martian surface, beneath massive frozen glaciers, and over rivers of broiling magma.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/header.jpg?t=1591105530,http://www.redfaction.com/,http://faq.deepsilver.com/,,True,False,False,75,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/red-faction-armageddon?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,3169,1196,,58,2232,,296,0,137,0,Volition,Deep Silver,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards",Action,"Action,Destruction,Sci-fi,Third Person,Third-Person Shooter,Singleplayer,Shooter,Mars,Co-op,Aliens,Multiplayer,Adventure,Linear,Open World,FPS,Horror,Physics,Gore","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_3de60777c06c7893741c51f1bc7f213ab1be9728.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_987738ad4ef70878637714fc333498a89a239988.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_2bebc85ddbb12aba20b0f1d686bcba94b75958cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_1edff37080c8e6d8cf35aea6e3cef2d6f67a2128.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_bb5edd024e5d54146a8888f7fd52ab839c38aff3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_26ebb6ff2155b91df1c3e0d79cfb9f5de04aaab1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_b4bd399ee5578062a79d93fe9eba5617a1ab063a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_cb6cc778978ecc16de57b2bae5326b90038c513c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_83f225151c339c921f3734e8031b98a1c247a7fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_1ae20f02fb727b2a2cc46634251df177df242219.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55110/ss_8fdc9b26b7ee5dbe96d16f5af37ff983811e08c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591105530",

The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute. Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained military force using only a sex toy in the most out- landish gameplay scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that will set Steelport on fire.

Fearing the police, and dealing with Daniel's newly manifested telekinetic power – the power to move objects with your mind – the boys decide to travel to their father's hometown of Puerto Lobos in Mexico for safety. Suddenly, sixteen year-old Sean is responsible for Daniel’s safety, shelter, and teaching him right from wrong. As Daniel's power grows, it’s up to Sean to decide the rules by which they live.

In only a few days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos. The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, these Agents are trained to operate independently in order to save society. When Society Falls, We Rise. Features In this action shooter RPG, you will get a unique gameplay experience, mixing tactical combat and online features. Stride across New York’s streets alone or with up to 3 friends and define the fate of your Agent. As you explore the map, encounter dynamic events, loot &amp; craft new weapons &amp; gear, and customize your Agent to take back the city from vicious enemy factions. As you finish the campaign you will unlock new difficulty levels and transition to a whole new experience: the endgame.

Spencer. Time has not been kind to Spencer: Five years after his heroic defeat of the Imperials, he has been betrayed by the government he swore to serve, imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit, and sentenced to death. On the very day of Spencer's execution, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that has turned the city into rubble and wiped out its population. With the terrain in ruins and the city's air defense grid now in the control of a massive terrorist force whose goal remains unclear, the FSA have only one option left - a behind-the-lines assault. It's the perfect job for a Bionic Commando. Bionic Commando transposes the much loved swing-and-shoot gameplay of the 8-bit original onto a stunning 3D environment of towering buildings, suspended roadways and monorails, deep canyons and sheer rock faces, which are traversed using swinging, scaling, climbing and wall-walking techniques. Key Features: Use the bionic arm to swing between towering skyscrapers at breathtaking speed, hook onto distant objects, zip up on hanging girders and choose your own route through the game Gameplay that moves through horizontal and vertical environments - a 3D game that truly uses all three dimensions.

In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost?

It’s a beautiful day here at the ballpark, and this game has been a squeaker! Everyone expected the league leaders to roll into town and easily defeat the home team. But the scrappy upstarts have played the game of their lives and managed to keep the score tied right until the end. Their fatigue is showing and now it's their last chance. If the home team batters don’t score a run now, the visitors will be sure to win the game in extra innings. It all comes down to the Bottom of the 9th! Will you lead the underdogs to victory? Or will you defend the league leaders’ unbroken winning streak? Bottom of the 9th is a strategic 2-player baseball game played with cards and dice. This faithful adaptation brings the fast-paced fun of the tabletop game to your computer! Choose your lineup from a pool of players with different strengths and abilities, outsmart your opponent in the stare-down, then roll the dice to trigger the action. Bottom of the 9th offers many ways to play: Compete in single player against a computer opponent (3 levels of difficulty) Take on the Manager's Challenge 6-game solo campaign mode Pass and play on your computer with a friend Challenge a friend to play online Find a worthy opponent in a ranked online match Organize a casual online exhibition game The powerhouse visitors have six dynamite pitchers to choose from, including: Wake Louder throws a nasty knuckleball that can get a lost ball just into the edge of the strike zone. Southpaw Straw is a talented lefty pitcher with one dangerously effective (and illegal) spitball. Hurricane Patriss is a top notch reliever, and the only thing more hypnotic than his curveball is his voice. Don't count out the home team! They have a dozen batters, each with their own special powers, including: Mully Nomah can be devastating against the pitching team when runners are in scoring position. He can clobber a pitch and get those base runners home! Kerry Rumble has power behind her swing. She has the ability to crush the ball hard, at the cost of hitting lots of fouls. She just can’t resist taking a swing! K.C. Petty is truly a powerhouse when the chips are down. The more strikes he gets, the bigger he swings. Hannah Cait may look innocent, but when she's in the zone she calls all the shots! This rookie's level of control over her swing is the envy of many a veteran. Both teams have access to two support characters who provide special abilities to one or both teams: Dice Dixon has no problem taking chances coming out from the dugout, benching batters and challenging umps! Doc Mullins is always looking after the health of the team, whether that means a more rested pitcher or more energized batters! The Manager's Challenge solo campaign mode puts you right in the dugout as a team manager. Can you lead your team to the playoffs in a 6-game homestand? Play six game solo campaigns as the home team against a revolving cast of pitchers. Compete in nine different game situations, including multiple inning games. Each campaign game is played using one of six effect cards that change the feel of the game.

You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen. Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0.

BlazBlue is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as 'the Library,' which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways. A round is called a 'rebel' and one match can consist of one to five 'rebels'. To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent's health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a 'unique' technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character. Key Features 12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager. Drive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent. Depending on the character control the elements like wind and ice or even absorb the life force from your opponents.

This arcade shooter takes place in the year 2022, as the Earth Defense Force fends off an all-out attack by unknown life forms. Become an EDF soldier, battle against endless hordes of immense enemies, and restore peace to the earth. Make way for the series' first humanoid aliens. Just what is this intelligent, extraterrestrial civilization that has attacked our own, known only as the Primers? Matching their intelligence, they bring the series' first humanoid alien foes. Battling against these intelligent foes will bring you to the depths of yet-unknown despair, and the heights of joy. Face the enemy with wisdom and courage! The most jam-packed entry yet, with online co-op play! This entry has more missions and weapons than any before it. On top of that, all missions support online co-op of up to 4 players, as well as local split-screen. Control the 4 classes and play with EDF soldiers all over the world. STORY This is no training exercise. This is the living nightmare we'd all feared. It all started in Japan, 2022. An immense fleet of starships laid siege to an EDF base located in the rough city outskirts in the Kanto region. This was an enemy humanity had never encountered, the Primers. Even worse, enormous insects attack the EDF base built even further underground. The EDF fights back. Even more realistic battles Armor will peel off where you shoot enemies, and their fluids will spill out onto buildings and floors, making you feel like you're truly on the EDF's battlefield. 4 EDF classes powered up like never before As the player, take on missions with one of four classes. Finish missions to unlock new ones and advance the story. You can switch classes before missions as many times as you'd like.","['English', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/header.jpg?t=1652254042,https://www.d3p.co.jp/edf5/,,steam_support@d3p.co.jp,True,False,False,76,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/earth-defense-force-5?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,6244,351,,39,5554,,1687,252,1704,252,SANDLOT,D3PUBLISHER,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Online Co-Op,Mechs,Co-op,Third-Person Shooter,Aliens,Shooter,Local Co-Op,Sci-fi,Split Screen,Multiplayer,Funny,Class-Based,Anime,Difficult,Singleplayer,Third Person,Hack and Slash,Female Protagonist","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/ss_d064f1fa8dc1739f11f41046dd5a230e5c32d9be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652254042,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/ss_815e4a10007c6948316cac958971823dbfc66bc4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652254042,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/ss_baf415e754c6ce61adb13fcc69a345d687cae12d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652254042,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/ss_288a622ae23e5769f3595404755c99348ce111da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652254042,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/ss_8d739649aa7836674ca3f6b1cad1fc9c260a62c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652254042,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1007040/ss_11e7356781b7eea650a293c38c79e56721f770f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652254042","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256753947/movie_max.mp4?t=1562565645,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256755684/movie_max.mp4?t=1562835238,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256755683/movie_max.mp4?t=1562835246,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256755688/movie_max.mp4?t=1562835255,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256755689/movie_max.mp4?t=1562835263"

Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/header.jpg?t=1654830036,http://www.callofduty.com,http://support.activision.com/,,True,False,False,68,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/call-of-duty-ghosts?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,17030,10793,,40,9170,,503,0,296,0,Infinity Ward,Activision,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Dog,FPS,Action,Multiplayer,Shooter,First-Person,Military,Singleplayer,War,Co-op,Online Co-Op,America,Linear,Fast-Paced,Hacking,Survival Horror,Futuristic,Tactical,Team-Based,Competitive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_40eccd8d9da36152496ed7cb625f1b3cde3848ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_4034e8573255a5cca333b42bb78aea9ec05118dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_007e6bb9311b3ebfc9441a6965699abc1f66971c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_f62dec40365369a31ecf04691fcabec9fed042bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_ada57e47a9fc25445a201ee189c3b44017224b42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/209160/ss_d0960fe4c60e578c033d8f5c23636e8808a04c0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654830036","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030019/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359449,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029955/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359325,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029908/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359288,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029794/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359231,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029788/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359230,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029623/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029593/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359068,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029594/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029595/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029596/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028745/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028743/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028744/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357970"
